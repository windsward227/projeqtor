The resource completes their work every day, for each assigned task.

Data entry for a resource is done on a weekly basis.

The corresponding cost to the real work is automatically updated to the assignment, activity and project.

.. _data-entryvalidation-timesheet:

.. rubric:: |threeBLC| Data entry validation


:kbd:`Enter real as planned` 

Planned work on an activity for a resource is carried forward for each day.

If there is no figure displayed then it means that the resource is not supposed to be informed of the actual work on this activity during this period.

Even if planned work is scheduled for a resource, there is nothing forcing it to complete its work as expected.

The option **Show planned work** must be activated.



:kbd:`Submit work` 

ProjeQtOr offers a system of validation of charges which makes it possible to follow the information of the real work of resources by a hierarchical manager.

After sending the actual work, you can no longer change the actual working time for the week.

You must cancel the validation request to make a change.

 
:kbd:`Validate work`

Project managers can validate the work or any other personalized profile authorized to do so.

Only people with the necessary permissions can see this button

When the work is validated, then the resource can no longer modify its work on this week. Likewise, the cancellation of validation will no longer be available.

The validation system is optional and can therefore be hidden.




.. _taskzone-imputation:

.. rubric:: |fourBLC| Task Zone


The list displays the tasks assigned to the resource selected in the list.

Click on the activity name to access the activity details screen.

Tasks assigned with actual work are always displayed, even when closed.

The function of the resource on this task is displayed at the end of the line.

.. Note:: 

   * A resource can have multiple :ref:`functions<resource-function-cost>`.

   * It is possible to :ref:`assign<assignment-section>` the same resource several times but with different functions to monitor project costs.


* The icon |AddComment| allows you to add a comment.
* The icon |Comment| indicates that there is a comment on the assigned task. 
* Simply move the mouse over the icon to see the latest comment.
* Click to view all comments
* A global comment can be added on the weekly follow-up.

           
The Start and End columns display the planned dates for each activity.

   
   


.. _entryfield-timesheet:

.. rubric:: |fiveBLC| Entry field


In order to see and know the assignments on a task, several columns indicate the periods assigned to a resource


 .. compound:: Assigned

   It is the work assigned to the resource that is calculated by the software.
   
 .. compound:: Real work

   This is the work actually performed and reported by the resource.
   
 .. compound:: Left work
   
   This is the work that the resource still has to provide for this task
   
   Left work is automatically decreased on input of real work.
   
   Resources can adjust this value to estimate the work needed to complete the task.
   
 .. compound:: Reassessed
   
   This is the work required to complete the task. It's the actual work + the rest to do. See: "progress-section-date-duration"
   
   * You cannot edit Assigned Work, Actual Work, and Reassessed directly in columns.
      
   * This information is calculated directly by the software based on what you have entered




.. _real-work-entry:

 .. compound:: Real work entry

   * Area to enter real work. It possible put real work in off days.
   * Columns of days off is displayed in grey.
   * Days off is determine in resource :ref:`calendar definition<calendars>`.


 .. compound:: Total of days
   
   On the last row is the sum for all days of the week. 
      
   It is a synthesis displayed for each project and globally for the whole week.
   
   The resource capacity is defined by the number of hours per day and the resource capacity (fte).

   * Total for the day is **green** if entries are completely within the resource's ETP capacity
   * The total for the day is **light red** if entries are greater than the resource's FTE capacity.
   * Total for the day is **dark red** if entries are greater than the maximum daily work allowed on the resource.
   * A message A message warns you that you exceed the authorized fixed quota.
   * You will not be able to save the timesheet with a higher quota
   * Total for the day is **uncolored** if entries are less than the resource's FTE capacity



.. seealso:: Timesheet parameters

   * :ref:`Unit for work<unitForWork-section>`
   
     Allows to set the unit time for real work and workload and the number of days worked per week. The number of hours per day is defined here.

.. _timesheet-status-task:

The status of tasks
===================

The task status can be changed automatically according to data entries on real work and left work.

* Set to first **in progress** status: if the parameter value is set to "Yes", when real work is entered on a task, its status will be changed automatically to the first status "In progress".

* Set to first **done** status: if the parameter value is set to "Yes", when left work is set to zero on a task, its status will be changed automatically to the first status "done".

 .. compound:: Change status validation

   An icon will be displayed on the task if a status change is applicable.

   * |statusStart| Due to real work is entered, the task status will be changed to the first 'In progress' status.
   * |statusStartKO| The real work is entered, but the task status will not change because at issue is occurring. 
   * |statusFinish| Due to no more left work, the task status will be changed to the first ‘done’ status.
   * |statusFinishKO| No more left work, but the task status will not change because at issue is occurring. 

   .. warning:: Common issue

    * If a :term:`responsible` or a :term:`result` are set as mandatory in element type definition for the task. It's impossible to set those values by real work allocation screen.
    * The change status must be done in treatment section on the task definition screen.

   Timesheet validation
   
   
The timesheet validation screen allows the project manager to receive, verify and validate the time allocated weekly by the resources to an activity for all the projects.

 .. compound:: Selection and filters
 
   You can filter the display of this screen by resource, by team and by period.

   The visibility of resources in the list is defined according to your rights defined by your profile.

   You can increase the display restriction with the possibility to show only some of the validation request.




 .. compound:: Color code

      According to the work completed by the resource, and according to the expected workload for this resource.
      
      The project leader receives the timesheet with a precise color code.
   
         * **Green:** The completed job is the same as the expected one.
   
         * **Red:** The filled workload is shorter or longer. It does not match the expected work.
   
         * **Orange:** the job is not the same as the expected job but the load is the same.

**Filters will limit the list:**

• Project to restrict the listed projects to this project and its sub-projects
• Project Type to restrict the listed projects to projects of this type
• Organization to restrict the listed projects to the projects of this organization
• Month and year to restrict to this date

.. note:: By default, this will be the last month for which projects are still blocked, or failing this it will be the current month.

**This screen will display for each project not validated:**

• The currently known CA
• The currently known validated load
• The total actual load currently known to the project
• The actual load consumed on the project for the selected month
• The remainder to be done currently known
• The currently known reassessed load
• The currently known margin (load) = load validated - load reassessed


For validated projects, the data displayed is that stored during validation.


.. rubric:: Block a project over a month

The |unlocked| and |locked| buttons allow you to block or unblock charges beyond the month-end date. When the project is blocked for a given month, you cannot enter a charge for the following month, even if it has started. The block will be propagated recursively to sub-projects.


.. rubric:: Validate a project over a month

The |submitted| and |unsubmitted| buttons allow you to block or unblock charges beyond the month-end date. When the project is blocked for a given month, you cannot enter a charge for the following month, even if it has started. The block will be propagated recursively to sub-projects.
