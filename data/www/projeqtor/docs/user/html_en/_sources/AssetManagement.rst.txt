You can limit the visibility of equipment.
   
some fields will be updated automatically to allow the user to see the items they have just created.
   
If a profile has creation rights and read rights only on "the items for which it is responsible", the creation must automatically position the manager on the current user.
   
If a profile has creation rights and read rights only on "its own elements", the creation must automatically position the user on the current user.
   
This rights management is automatically extended to all elements not dependent on the project.
