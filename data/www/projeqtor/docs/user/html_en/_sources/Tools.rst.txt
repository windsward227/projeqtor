   **What is the GDPR?**

   The abbreviation GDPR stands for "General Data Protection Regulation" (GDPR). The GDPR governs the processing of personal data in the territory of the European Union.
   
   The legal context adapts to follow developments in technologies and in our societies (increased use of digital technology, development of online commerce, etc.).
   
   This new European regulation is a continuation of the French Data Protection Act of 1978 and strengthens the control by citizens of the use that may be made of data concerning them.
   
   It harmonizes the rules in Europe by offering a unique legal framework to professionals. It helps to develop their digital activities in the EU based on the trust of users.

.. index:: Import data

.. _import-data:

Import data
-----------

Imports data from CSV or XLSX files.


.. rubric:: How to do

1. Select the element type from the list.
2. Select file format (CSV or XLSX).
3. Select the file.
4. Click on **Import data** button to start importing.

.. rubric:: Report of the import

* Data that is not imported because not recognized as a field appear in grey text in the result table.
* Data that are voluntarily not imported (because must be calculated) appear in blue text in the result table.

.. rubric:: Import users

* The password field must be cut and pasted from the database because it is encrypted.
* If you enter some readable password, the users will not be able to connect.

.. warning:: 

   * If you want to create new users **don't put any id** because if id already exists, it will be overridden by the new (with possibility to erase admin user…).
   * Always keep in mind that your import may have some impact on administrator user.
   * So be sure to keep an operational admin access.


.. rubric:: Importing document versions

* Two ways to import document versions:
 
   - by describing only the version, with its standard fields.    
   - by describing the document and the version (the name of the fields of the version will be followed by '(DocumentVersion)', or its translation into the current language).

.. note:: CSV import 
    
    * The CSV import file may also include :  
        - 'importFile' field that will give the link to the version file (this file will have to be reachable by the PHP server).
        - 'target' field that can be set to 'DELETE' (the file to be imported is deleted after import) or a directory name (the file to be imported is moved to this directory after import) or nothing (the file to be imported is not modified).
    
    
.. raw:: latex

    \newpage


.. _file-format:

File format
"""""""""""

The content of the imported file must fit the element type description.

To know the data that may be imported, click on the |Help| button.

.. rubric:: Names of columns 

* The first line of the file must contain the name of the fields.
* Names of columns can contain spaces (to have better readability).
* The spaces will be removed to get the name of the column.

.. tip:: 
   
   * Look into the model class. The names are the same.

.. rubric:: Date format

* Dates are expected in format “YYYY-MM-DD”.






Data import process
"""""""""""""""""""

Operations are performed, depending on whether the element type, the column or the column value.

.. rubric:: Column Id 

You may or may not add an "id" column in the file.

 .. compound:: **Column "id" exists and "id" is set in a line** 

    * The import will try to update the corresponding element, and will fail if it does not exist.

 .. compound:: **Column "id" does not exist or if "id" is not set in a line**

    * The import will create a new element from the data.  

.. rubric:: Linked tables

For columns corresponding to linked tables ("idXxxx"), you can indicate as the column name  either "idXxxx“ or “Xxxx" (without "id") or the caption of the column (as displayed on screens).

 .. compound:: **Numeric value**

    * If the value of the column is numeric, it is considered as the code of the item.

 .. compound:: **Non numeric value**

    * If the value of the column contains non numeric value, it is considered as the name of the item, and the code will be searched for the name. 

.. rubric:: **Columns with no data**

* In any case, columns with no data will not be updated.
* Then you can update only one field on an element.

.. rubric:: **Clear data**

* To clear a data, enter the value "NULL" (not case sensitive).


.. rubric:: Planning elements

* Insertion into "Planning" elements (activity, project), automatically inserts an element in the table “PlanningElement”.
* The data of this table can be inserted into the import file.

.. rubric:: Tickets

* Do not import the value of "real work" on tickets, even if it is specified in the import file.






.. index:: Import data (Automatic)

Automatic import
""""""""""""""""

Imports can be automated.

Files placed on a defined directory will automatically be imported.

.. note:: 

   * Automatic import parameters must be set in :ref:`Global parameters<automatic-import>`.
   * Background task must be started by :ref:`admin-console`.
 
The files must respect some basic rules.  

.. rubric:: File name format

* File name format is : "Class"_"Timestamp"."ext"
* Example of import file name: Ticket_20131231_235959.csv

 .. compound:: **Class**

    * The type of item to be imported (Ticket, Activity, Question, …).

 .. compound:: **Timestamp**

    * Timestamp defined to be able to store several files in the directory.
    * Format is free.
    * The recommended format is “YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS”.

 .. compound:: **Ext**

    * File extension, representing its format.
    * Valid extensions are CSV and XLSX.

.. rubric:: File format

* The files must follow the ProjeQtOr :ref:`file-format`.
* Files must be full and consistent.

.. tip::

   * The files should not be directly created in the import folder.
   * They must be created in a temporary folder and moved afterwards. 



.. rubric:: Import process

* Correctly imported files are moved to a “done” sub folder of the import folder.
* If an error occurs during import of a file, the full file is moved to “error” sub-folder of the import folder, even if there is only one error over many other items correctly integrated.
* You can get the result as a log file and/or email summary.

Cloned Environnement
--------------------

You can duplicate the complete environment (data and code) to form a simulation environment. 

.. important:: The CRON program must be started and running so that the simulation request can be taken into account and can be generated.

Click on |Parameter| on the Simulation Management screen
   
   
 .. compound:: Management of rights and limitations per profils

   Definition of profiles that have the right to create a simulation.
   
   You can limit the number of total simulations per profiles.
   
   This limitation can have some advantages:
      
      * Avoid saturating the server.
      * Force users to clean up their files.
      * Limit performance degradation caused by the creation of a simulated environment

   The removal requests are decremented. If the limits are reached, the request screen to create a simulated environment is blocked.
   
   
   .. figure:: /images/GUI/TOOLS_BOX_RequestInvalid.png
      :alt: Invalid Request
      
      Example of a invalid request due to too much creation request.
      
      
   
   
  
 .. compound:: Sequencing of the creation of simulations

   The time required to create a simulation space may vary. Depending on your database, your servers or even if several requests are generated simultaneously. It is an operation which can take time. That is why you can set frequencies for creation requests.
   
   * **Fixed frequency**
   
     Analyzes creation requests at regular intervals and starts the generation of simulation environment as soon as a request is encountered.
   
   * **At a given time**
   
     In order to avoid any slowing down of the database, you can program the generations of the spaces at a specific time of the day. This allows these to be programmed outside working hours.
     

 .. compound:: Copying datas
   
   It is necessary to copy the code and the data because the simulations created in a version could no longer be compatible with the code of the main instance that has migrated.

   The creation of a simulation instance is a heavy process for the server: duplication of code, duplication of data...
   
   That's why when generating your simulation space, not all data is copied.
   
  
      **Is not copied**
      
           * Archived data (closed)
           * Update history
           * Attached documents and files
      
      **Copy of the code** 
      
      * Disabling all automation and notifications.
      
      * Update the simulations table to record the actual creation:
      
           * Date and time of actual creation,
           * Flag "available environment"
           * Instance access URL

   Identify the profile making the request, name your space (required) and confirm your request by clicking on OK
   
   **The simulated databases will always have a name prefixed by \simu_ followed by the name of the simulation.**
   


 .. compound:: Dates

   * Creation dates: Indicate precisely the date on which you made your request for simulation space.

   * Availability dates: Indicates the date on which your space was actually generated. They are indicated to you when your request is taken into account.

   * Delation dates: Indicates the date on which your space will be completely deleted. The simulation space must actually be generated for the deletion request status to appear. If the database is in the request phase and therefore not yet generated, then the deletion is immediate and the deletion request status does not appear..
   
   
 .. compound:: Color code
   
   * **Blue:** Request being created
   * **Orange:** Warning (delete request)
   * **Red:** Error creating the environment (path, rights ...)
   * **Green:** Environment creates
   
      
 .. compound:: Go to the cloned Environment
   
   When your simulation is ready, green status, you can open your cloned environment.
   Click on |Goto| to launch the environment.
   
   A new tab opens with a new ProjeQtOr session. Authenticate yourself, you can start working in your environment.

      Cloned environment session
   
   The instance area turns red when you are in a simulation space.
   
   Not all screens or functions will be accessible in this space. 
   
   For example, you will not be able to request and create a new simulation space in your cloned environment.   
     
     
 .. compound:: Copy a cloned Environment
   
   You did a successful simulation on one of your cloned environment. 

   You want the copy to run other tests but without touching the simulation.

   Just copy this environment.

   The origin of the copy will then be indicated in the list with a shortcut to access it.



 .. compound:: Deleting a simulation environment

   Deletion requests are stored in the simulation table. 
   
   They are processed in the same process as creations, but always with priority to free up space before allocating new resources to new instances.
   

.. tip::

   To avoid overly broad rights management and server invasion problems, all simulations (code) will be placed in a "simulation" directory outside of the main ProjeQtOr directory. 
   
   Thus, if the main instance is accessible via the url "projeqtor.xxx.fr", the simulations will be accessible via the url "projeqtor.xxx.fr/simulation/nom_de_simulation".
