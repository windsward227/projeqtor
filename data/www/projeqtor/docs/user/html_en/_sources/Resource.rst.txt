.. _fte:
.. index:: FTE - Full time equivalent

.. rubric:: Full Time Equivalent

FTE stands for "full-time equivalent". This is the number of hours worked by a single employee in a day.

* 1 FTE (full time equivalent)  
* < 1 for part time working resource or variations of capacity
* > 1 for virtual resources or teams, pool of ressource or variations of capacity

.. note:: 

   If you want a resource pool of three people, the FTE capacity must be set to 3

.. rubric:: Max work

* You can set a maximum value beyond which no charge can be entered.
* For example, being able to define that a user cannot enter more than 12 hours per day. 
* You can set a limit per day and a limit per week.
* The resource will not be able to enter more than the number of hours authorized on its timesheets.

See: :ref:`Real work entry<real-work-entry>`

.. rubric:: Field is a contact

* Check this if the resource must also be a :ref:`contact`.
* The resource will then also appear in the “Contacts” list. 

.. rubric:: Field is a user

* Check this if the resource must connect to the application.
* You must then define the **User name** and **Profile** fields.
* The resource will then also appear in the :ref:`user` list. 

.. rubric:: Field is a employee

* Check this box if the resource needs to be linked to the human resources module.
* The resource will then also appear in the :ref:`employee-manager` list.

.. _variation-capacity:
   
Variations in resource capacity
-------------------------------

You can record dates (start and end) to indicate that the capacity (FTE) of your resource will vary during this period.

This allows you to reserve and enter additional working time (overtime) or to withdraw hours at standard capacity (recovery).

The resource will then enter its imputations, the exact value of its variable capacity for the given period.
1 + XX hours for the status of the day to go green

The surcapacity of a resource is directly visible on the Gantt chart.

A thin red stripe overcomes the resource work allocation bars and you will find the exact capacity added at the end of the resource detail.

.. index:: Surbooking

.. _surbooking:

Managment of surbooking periods
-------------------------------

Surbooking in planning allows you to add extra work time on the standard capabilities of your resources to plan more projects that you will not process.

You can also subtract this work time to not plan the full availability of resources.

The resource will continue to report their charges normally, with no extra or reduced work time, to change the status of their day to green.

   Variations in the capacity


.. Warning::

   variable capacity and overbooking do not behave in the same way.
   
   Variable capacity will be more used to control and record periods of actual overtime and the behavior of imputations
   will be adapted to this ability.
   
   overbooking is a way of planning in the future without interacting with the behavior of the working time of the resources

Two resources A and B are incompatible.

If A is scheduled at a given time, B can not be scheduled on the same day as for a load less than or equal to the remaining availability of To date, 

that is, the minimum of [capacity of the resource-load already planned] for each incompatible resource and reciprocally with the relation is bijective.

If resource B is the resource resource of resource A, if A and planned at a given moment, B must also be automatically planned pro-rata indicated as employment rate in the definition of the support resource.

If A's support resource B is not available (in part or in full), we plan for A only the part that is available taking into account the employment rate.

The display of the scheduled load for the support resource, although it is not assigned to the activity, is visible on the detail of a right-click Gantt bar.

.. topic:: Exemple

   Example with B support resource of A with a 50% employment rate

      * Day x, A is available 1.0 d and B 1.0 d: A is planned 1.0 d, B is planned 0.5 d.
      
      * Day y, A is available 0.5 d and B 1.0 d: A is planned 0.5 d, B is planned 0.25 d

A pool is a group of resources that can work as any of the assigned resources.

You assign resources to the pool at a given rate for a given period.

A resource cannot be assigned on pools for more than 100% on a given period 

   * A pool can be allocated to projects like any resource.
   * A pool can be assigned to activities like resources. The difference is that when you assign a pool, you don't specify the rate but the FTE (Full Time Equivalent) assigned to the activity. It means the number of resources that can work at the same time on the activity.
   * A pool does not have a specific capacity. It's capacity is calculated from capacity and rate of assigned resources.

.. _behavior-pool:

Behaviour
---------

Find here some information on the type of behavior of certain elements


  .. compound:: Automatic decrement for assigned work
  
     * When you assign a pool to an activity, and then assign a resource of the pool to the same activity, then assigned work on the resource is automatically subtracted from assignment of the pool
     * The same way, when you assign a pool to an activity, and then assign a resource of the pool to a sub-activity of this activity, then assigned work on the resource is automatically subtracted from assignment of the pool
     * When you assign a pool to an activity, and then assign the same pool to a sub-activity of this activity, then assigned work on the pool on the sub-activity is automatically subtracted from assignment of the pool on the parent activity

  .. compound:: Planning

     * When planning a pool, availability of unitary resources already booked on other tasks is taken into account
     * When planning an unitary resource, availability already booked through the pool on other tasks is also taken into account (globally for all the resources of the pool)

  .. compound:: Possible use cases for pool

     * When you have a group of resources that may work on same tasks, but you don't know in advance who will work. For instance a maintenance team that may work on maintenance tasks and other project tasks
     * For macro planning
     * Define a poll for each group of resources (depending for instance on competencies)
     * On first step, assign fake resources to the pools, and plan your project with the pools : you get a first draft of your project, even before knowing who will work on the project, and without needing to go to a very detailed level of tasks (it's macro planning, you just have macro tasks)
     * Then when you know who will work on the project : just replace the fake resource with real resources : you immediately get a realistic planning taking into account availability of real resources already booked on other projects. It's still a macro planning, but realistic.
     * Then you can draw you detailed planning, just adding sub-activities to your macro tasks, and assigning real resources to the lowest level activities : when you add assigned work, it is automatically subtracted from assigned work on the pool on the macro task, and golbal assigned work on the project is constant.
    
  .. compound:: Delete an assignment

     * When deleting an assignment, the remaining job is reassigned within the pool  
  
  









.. _aggregated-resource:

Aggregated resource
-------------------

The aggregated resource allows you to choose a single resource from a resource pool.

When you assign a resource pool to an activity, a check box appears: single resource.

If you select single resource then you will have no FTE capacity to fill in but a busy rate on the activity.

Check the box and confirm to close the pop up.

.. figure:: /images/GUI/RESOURCE_BOX_AllocationPool.png
   :alt: Allocate the resource pool to the activity 


When the pool is allocate, the pool icon appears on the board. 

If you chose the **unique resource** then the 1 number will be displayed on the icon.

Similarly, the function of the resource chosen from the pool is indicated in brackets. 

.. figure:: /images/GUI/RESOURCE_ZONE_AllocationPool.png
   :alt: Pool allocation

Click on |Edit| to edit the allocation.

The pop up opens again and this time you have the summary table showing you the resources of your pool 

and the dates each resource can or should finish the activity.

You must fill in the activity load to see the end dates of the pool resources.

Otherwise the message 'not planned work' appears instead of the dates.


.. figure:: /images/GUI/RESOURCE_BOX_AllocationPool_Edit.png

Choose the appropriate resource by selecting the corresponding line and confirm.

Basic, ProjeQtOr will automatically select the fastest resource to complete the task.

The selected resource will then be the only one to be planned on this activity from the pool.
