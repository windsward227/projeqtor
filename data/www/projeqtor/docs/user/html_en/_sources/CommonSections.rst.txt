Click on the resource name to go directly to the selected resource.


.. _allocationrate:

 .. compound:: Allocation rate
 
   The allocation rate on the resource calculates the percentage of allocation to be taken into account for the planning according to the calendar of the resource.

   For example, if the resource has a standard France calendar, then the resource works 5 days a week.

   * His assignment rate on the project is 100%, the resource can be scheduled without a ceiling and can possibly work on this project up to 5 days a week.
   
   * His assignment rate on the project is 50%, so the resource can be scheduled for a maximum of 2.5 days per week on this project.
   
   * His assignment rate on the project is 20% so the resource can be scheduled for a maximum of 1 day per week on the project 



      
.. _replace-resource-allocation:

 .. compound:: Replace resource
   
   * Replace resource on an allocation: all tasks assigned will be transferred to the new resource with assigned and left work.
   
   * Work done on tasks still belongs the old resource.

   * - Comments
     - Any comment on the allocation. When a comment exists, |Comment| will appear on the assignment list, and on the description of the activity on the “real work allocation” screen. Moving the mouse over the icon will display the comment.

 
.. _assignmentrate:

 .. compound:: Assignment rate
 
   The assignment rate on the resource calculates the percentage of assignment to take into account for the planning according to the FTE of the resource.

   For example, if the resource has an FTE of 1 then the resource works the whole day.

   * Its assignment rate on the activity is 100%, the resource may be planned without a ceiling and may possibly work full days on this project.

   * Its activity assignment rate is 50%, so the resource can be planned for a maximum of 0.5 per day.

   * Its assignment rate on the activity is 20% so the resource can be planned 0.2 per day at most.
   
   
   

Multiple assignment to a task
=============================

   * A resource can be assigned more than once to a task.
   * Allows to assign the resource to the same task with a different function (different daily cost).
   * Allows to add extra work without modifying initial assignment.


.. _automatic-assignment:

Automatic assignment to a task
==============================

   You can automatically assign the entire project team (all the resources assigned to the project) to a given activity. 
   
   This assignment is dynamic, when you add a resource to the project it is automatically added to the activity.
   
   
   * Switch the button to automatically assign the ressources of the project to the activity.

   * The entire project team will be added to the assignment table.
   
      * We only take into account the resources assigned directly to the project of the activity, not the parent project, 
      * The allocation must not be closed
      * The assignment function is the default function of the resource
      * Rated load is zero
      * Assignment rate is 100%

   .. important:: Only Resources assigned to the project are assigned, not users or contacts who are not also resources.


   * If you remove a resource from the assignment, that resource is not removed from the project.

   * Automatic assignment does not generate duplicates. If a resource already exists in the assignments, its assignment is not duplicated.

   * On the other hand, if the assignment is closed it will be reopened (if the activity is not itself closed).
   
   * If the allocation of the resource on the project is deleted or closed then the assignment on the activity is automatically closed so that resources can no longer be attributed to the activity even if the resource has work remaining.



.. note:: When this option is unchecked, the assignments will not be deleted (there is no way to know if the assignment was generated dynamically or manually). Only the automation for newly assigned Resources will be disabled.






.. _recurrent-mode-assign:

Recurrent mode assignment
=========================

The recurring planning mode is the only mode that, by default, covers the entire duration of the project.

If the project is lengthened, then the task in recurring mode will lengthen accordingly.

.. figure:: /images/GUI/GANTT_BOX_RecurrentAssignment.png
   :alt: Recurring assignment
   
   Recurring assignment


During the assignment, you distribute the workload of your resource on a weekly basis.

You can enter a different value for each day of the week.

The :kbd:`copy` is an accelerator to copy the entered value on Monday every other day.

The total load will be calculated after validation according to the duration of your project and the assigned times.

.. warning:: 

   * It is a priority planning method.
   * Using this mode can add a significant workload!.














.. _plannedintervention-assign:

Planned Interventions assignment
================================

The assigned workload is no longer determined but will be entered on a calendar which can be clicked, per half-day.

See: :ref:`Planned interventions assignment<plannedintervention-assign>`

 .. compound:: Display Manual planning calendar  

   * Click on |Add| to add a new assignment. 
   
   * To see the workload distribution table, select the resource and confirm. Then click on the edit button.

      * If the assignment already exists, click directly on the |Edit|.

      * The calendar will then be displayed in the assignment window..
   
   * The display starts in the current month and spans the next six months.
   
   * Each box is divided into two half days. The assigned work is then automatically the sum of the selected half-days.
   

   

.. figure:: /images/GUI/GANTT_BOX_PlanningManual-Assignment.png

 .. compound:: Distribution of the workload for a new assignment 

   * click on a box to enter a workload.

     Depending on the :ref:`global parameter<GP-effectCapacity>`, this workload will be either planned work or real work. 
   
   * Each day is represented by two half-days (am and pm)

   * You can plan for the 6 months following the date of the assignment

   * The half-days filled in will be visible on the screen of planned interventions

   * Save this data with the save button
   

.. _activity-on-real-time: 

Activity on real time
=====================

When you check the activity option at the time spent on an activity then several fields will no longer be accessible and a recalculation of the load will be carried out:

* Recalculation of the rated load = revised load when modifying the remainder to be done

* Recalculation of the remainder to be done = rated load - actual load when changing the assigned load. This is the existing operation in all cases

* Prohibition to modify the assigned load to a value lower than the actual load. You will then have a blocking message



.. _treatment-section: 

Treatment section
-----------------

This section contains information on the treatment of articles, ie on the life and progress of the element.

It usually contains status information, macro reports, situations or those responsible for the work of this element.

 .. compound:: in progress
    
   The field is filled in when you fill in the first charge on your timesheet.

   Please note, the date recorded in the in progress field is the date on which the charge is entered and not the day on which it is entered.
    
 .. compound:: Done
    
   The field is filled in when you fill in the last charge on your timesheet.

   The remaining time MUST therefore be at 0 for this field to be completed.
    
 .. compound:: Closed
    
   The field is filled in when you close an element
    
 .. compound:: Cancelled

   The field is filled in when you cancel the element via the status of your workflow



.. rubric:: Other options

ProjeQtOr offers you several options to build your projects, protect them, or even pause them depending on the hazards you may encounter. 


 .. compound:: Fix planning

   * The project is never re-calculated.
   
   * It means the planning will always be the same whatever you do on other projects.
   
   .. important:: 
      
      This may lead to dependencies unconsistency.
   
 .. compound:: Paused 
 
   * Available on projects and activities.
 
   * The planning is never recalculated.
   
   * Unlike "fix planning", the current planning for the project is erased.
   
   * This is used to postpone the project to an undetermined date.   

 .. compound:: Non extendable project

   * You can't add new elements to this project, 
   
   * You can't delete elements from this project.
   
   * You can't move elements from/to this project.

   :alt: Progress Section
   :align: center
   
   Progress section
   

Description of the different sections is grouped by the planning elements that have common fields and behavior.

Progress data are displayed in the same format, **but according to the planning element, fields can have another meaning or behavior.**

Below is the definition of the different columns that make up the Progress section.



.. _progress-section-date-duration:

Dates and duration
==================

The dates and durations section allow you to record and display different time information on your element.


.. rubric:: Validated

Validated dates are used for:

* Define the input parameters according to the selected planning mode - See: :ref:`Planning mode<planningmodeGantt>`

* Define the initial due dates as a reference in order to check any drifts in your project.

* Set a deadline by which the work must be completed. You will be able to compare your validated dates with the planned dates of the software to follow the possible drifts of your projects.

* Directly on the project screen, without any other constraint, determines the start of planning for it.



.. rubric:: Planned

Planned dates can be defined with:

 .. compound:: **Requested or validated dates**

    The planned dates can be initialized with validated dates or requested dates (whether validated dates are not specified).

 .. compound:: **Planning calculation**

    The planned dates are determined during the planning calculation. 
       
    The planning calculation is done according to tasks assigned to resources and their predecessors.

    .. note:: **Planning mode "Fixed duration"**

      The planned dates of tasks will be calculated depending on their predecessors and their specified duration.

    .. warning:: **Planned dates of parent element**
      
      At parent element level, dates are adjusted with the first planned start date and the last planned end date from all sub-elements.

      The planned start date is adjusted to the real start date when work began.


The planned dates are calculated by the software. You do not have the possibility to change these dates manually.

These dates are calculated according to the many constraints that you have defined (FTE, Rates, Dependencies, Charges, priorities, availability ...).

 .. compound:: Delay display

   If the dates entered in the validated dates are lower than the dates calculated by the software - the planned dates, then the planned end date box is red as well as the bar of the Gantt chart corresponding to the element.
   
   This then reflects a possible delay.
   
   .. figure:: /images/GUI/COMMON_ZONE_DelayDates.png
      :alt: planned dates greater than validated dates
      
      The planned dates are greater than validated dates 
   
   
.. rubric:: Real

These are the dates of work actually carried out. The work actually charged

The real start date is set when work began (In progress).

The real end date is set when no more remaining work (done).

.. note:: Real dates of parent element 

   The real start date will be propagated to parent elements up to project.
   
   The real end date for parent element will be initialized, when all sub-element have been completed.
   
   
The real work is actually being done. It is filled via the timesheet screen.

The items containing actual work cannot be deleted.

To enable this, you must first remove the actual work or configure the forced deletion in the :ref:`specific access<specific_access>`.


.. rubric:: Requested

Allows you to define forecast dates. These are generally the dates agreed with your client or the beneficiary of your activity..

Unless they are the only indicated, these dates have no impact on the planning.

If no validated date is specified and no constraints are applied then they can initialize the planned dates.

.. rubric:: Duration

The durations correspond to the number of days between the start and end dates.

These are always integer values, without decimals!

They are calculated automatically.

But you can also enter a start date and a number of whole days, the end date will be automatically calculated.





.. _progress-section-resource:

Costs and works
===============

The cost of resources is calculated thanks to the workload allocated to each resource on the tasks.

You must fill in a function associated with a daily cost for your resources.

See: :ref:`Function and cost<function-cost-resource>` on the resources screen





.. rubric:: Validated

Allows to define scheduled work and budgeted cost of resources.

 .. compound:: **Work**
 
    This value is used for calculation of the expected progress and project margin (work).

 .. compound:: **Cost**

    This value is used for calculation of project margin (cost).

.. note:: **Project**

   The values of work and cost can be initialized with the sum of total work and amount of all project orders.
   
   See: :ref:`Incomes<orders>`

.. rubric:: Assigned

Sum of planned work assigned to resources and estimated cost.

.. rubric:: Real

Sum of work done by resources and cost incurred.

Left work can also be changed on assignment, at project management level.

.. rubric:: Reassessed

Sum of resource total work that will be needed from start to end and the ensuing costs.

   .. code::
    
      [Reassessed] = [Real] + [Left]

.. topic:: Work on tickets

   * Sum of work done on tickets and costs is included in work of activity linked through the “planning activity” of tickets.
   * Sum of work done on tickets that don't link to any activity will be integrated in the work of the project.






.. _progress-section-expense-reserve:


Expense tracking
================
This section is used by Project.

See: :ref:`Project reserve<project-reserve>`

.. rubric:: Validated (Expense)

.. _progress-section-steering:

Steering
========
  
   
.. rubric:: Progress

Percentage of actual progress.

Calculated by the sum of the work done divided by sum of work reassessed.

   .. code:: 
      
      [Progress %] = [real work] / [reassessed work] 
      
      = [real work] / ( [real work] + [left work] )

 .. compound:: Expected

   Percentage of expected progress.
   
   Calculated by the sum of the work done divided by scheduled work.
   
      .. code:: 
         
         [Expected %] = [real work] / [validated work]

 .. compound:: WBS

   Hierarchical position in the global planning.

.. rubric:: Priority

Allows to define priority to a project or activity. 

By default, the value is set to "500" (medium priority).
  
1 being the highest priority and 999 the lowest priority.

See: :ref:`Planning priority<scheduling-priority>`.

See: :ref:`Steering section for activity<gantt-details-area>`

Depending on the planning mode selected, the calculation of your planning will not be executed in the same way.

* See :ref:`Concepts<planning-mode-concept>`
* See :ref:`Planning modes<planningmodeGantt>`

  
.. rubric:: Minimum threshold
 
When this value is set, the activity will only be scheduled on the day that the daily availability will be greater than or equal to this threshold.

You also have the option to add a new property to a "not splitted work" task.

This will require defining the minimum work to be allocated each day and thus filling in the minimum threshold field

Planning will require finding consecutive days with at least the given value possible.

See: :ref:`Minimum threshold<minimumthreshold>`


.. rubric:: Fix planning
 
Fix planning will avoid the recalculation of planning for an activity.
  
To fix the project see: :ref:`treatment-section`


.. rubric:: Paused
 
When an activity is paused, it is never recalculated.

Unlike **fix the planning**, the current schedule for the project is purged. 

This amounts to postponing the activity to an undetermined date. 

When this option is checked, the option **fix the planning** is automatically checked.
  

.. rubric:: Activity on real time
 
When you check the option ** activity at time spent ** then the validated load becomes read-only and the calculation of the validated load equals the revised load.

The option can be disabled manually even if it has been set to the activity type.

The option is incompatible with activities managed by "Work Units" (turnover module). The field will then not be visible and the "Unit of work", "complexity" and "quantity" fields will be hidden if the "activity over time" option is activated.

It will therefore be necessary to deactivate the option to make these fields reappear.
