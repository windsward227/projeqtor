Agile Methods
*************

:term:`Agile methods` are groups of practices of piloting and realization of projects. 
They originate from the Agile Manifesto, written in 2001, which uses the term "agile" to refer to multiple existing methods.

Agile methods are more pragmatic than traditional methods, involve the client as much as possible and allow a great reactivity to his requests. They are based on an iterative, incremental and adaptive development cycle and must respect four fundamental values, based on twelve principles, from which a base of practices, either common or complementary, derives.

The Kanban methodology comes from the Japanese automotive industry. It was created with the aim of optimizing the production capacity.

The Kanban method is based on the continuous improvement of production processes to enable lean production management.

The Kanban approach is a stock management method that allows you to produce on demand.

The main objective is to balance production and demand.


   **With Kanban, you can create a new Kanban board for**
   
      * Tickets,
      * Activities,
      * Actions,
      * Requirements
   
   * Add / Remove columns to an existing Kanban board
   * Direct update of elements

  You will need to define:
 
  * **Name** for the new Kanban board
      
  * **Type of item:** you can define a Kanban of Tickets, Activities, Actions or Requirements
      
      
  When you have selected the item type, you must then define the type of Kanban board to apply:
            
  * **Status:** you will manage the most standard "status based" kanban board
  * **Target product version:** you can distribute the tickets among the target product version
  * **Planning activity:** You will be able to send tickets among planning activities, which can be your Sprints in the Scrum method.

   You can view the work information of items on each column.
         
   The estimated work, actual work, and work remaining information on the selected item can be displayed
   
   If your profile is not allowed to see the job, you will not have access to this option.
   
   The format for displaying the job (days or hours) depends on the overall configuration:
   
      * **unit for real work allocation** for Tickets
      * **unit for workload** for Activities

       
  .. compound:: Show closed items
  
   You switch to archive mode. You can view the closed elements.     
       
       
  .. compound:: Show large element
  
   By default, Kanban board columns display two tiles side by side.

   By displaying the tiles in wide mode, each tile takes the maximum width of the column.

  .. compound:: Hide backlog
  
   When you create a kanban, you do not yet have columns representing a state, a set of states or even versions.
   
   The tiles then appear in a Backlog column.
   
   You have the option to hide this column.
    
    
.. rubric:: Element management

Find below the details of the tiles of your kanbans


 .. compound:: Details of an element
 
  .. figure:: /images/GUI/AGILE_ZONE_TileKanban.png
  
  |one| ID of the element with in the background the project color
  
  |two| The type of the element
  
  |three| The name of the element
  
  |four| Status in which the tile is located in relation to your :ref:`workflow`
  
  |five| The target product version
  
  |six| The planning activity or parent activity related to the element
  
  |seven| The description of the element 
  
  |eight| Estimated work | Real work | Left work
  
  |nine| Responsible of work Photo - The name is displayed on mouse over
  
  |ten| Priority of the element - Priorities are customizable. See :ref:`list of values<priority>`
  
  |eleven| Add a note. The number of notes is displayed on the icon
  
  |twelve| Edit the element
  
  |thirteen| Go to the element screen

 .. compound:: Moves an element
 
  To move tickets, activities, or anything else from your kanban, drag and drop a ticket into the corresponding column.

  .. figure:: /images/GUI/AGILE_ZONE_DragDrop.png
    :alt: Move an element
   
    Move an element

  The heading of the moved element then changes to green when it is on a column where the movement is allowed and is red when it is on a column where the movement is prohibited.

  If the Kanban is arranged as statuses, the new status after move, will be the first status of the range defined for the column.

  For Kanbans based on the target product version and planning activities, the new field value will simply be the target.


 .. compound:: Forbidden moves
 
  Displacements will change the value of the corresponding field for the moved element.
  
  But the "status" change must respect the workflow configuration for the given item type. This is why some movements are prohibited.
  
  Permitted moves are easily identified from prohibited moves by the color of the Ticket header or the moved Activity.  
  
  
 .. compound:: Updating
 
  Depending on the configuration of the ticket type, some state changes may require the definition of new fields.

  For example, in the default configuration, when changing to the "assigned" state, "responsible" is required, and when transitioning to the "terminated" state, "result" is required ".

  In this case, when you move a ticket in the Kanban columns, a pop-up window appears to allow you to enter the missing value if it is not already defined.

.. _planning-poker:

Planning Poker
**************

Planning Poker, also known as Scrum Poker, is a consensus-based gamified estimation technique primarily used to estimate the relative effort or size of development goals. (wikipedia)

Projeqtor integrates planning poker into its functionalities. You will be able to plan a planning poker session as a meeting and see it appear on the Gantt chart.

You define the project to which the session is linked, the user story (s) as well as the voters.




.. _planning-poker-session:

Planning poker session
----------------------

The planning poker session screen is reserved for the session organizer and certain supervision profiles.

A planning poker session can be scheduled and is visible on the Gantt chart of the planning view.


.. figure:: /images/GUI/Agile_SCR_PlanningPokerSession.png
   :alt: Planning poker session screen
   
   Planning poker session screen


.. rubric:: Run a poker session
   
You define a date for your session, one or more user stories and the participants in the votes.

Click on :kbd:`Run estimate` in front of the user stories you want to launch or on :kbd:`run all` to launch all the user stories

When at least one user story is started, then voters will be able to access it on the planning poker estimate screen.

Only profiles with update rights can vote on the planning poker sessions screen.

The user story estimate is identical between the planning poker session screen and the planning poker estimate screen. 
   
   
 .. compound:: Planning poker type

   In ProjeQtOr, basic, you find the types "live session" or "session with a due date".
   
   The types are customizable and can be changed according to your needs.
   
   See: :ref:`Planning poker type<planning-poker-type>`
   
   
 .. compound:: User story

   The User Story represents an Agile practice, used above all in Scrum, to “capture” the needs of the users by expressing in a general and not detailed way, the characteristics, the functions and the requirements of the product to be created.
   
   In ProjeQtOr, a user story can be a ticket, an activity or a requirement.
   
   A session can contain several user stories, there is no limit.
   
   Each of these user stories can be started individually, in part or in full.
   


 .. compound:: Attendees

   Participants can be resources, contacts, or users.
   
   Participants are assigned as on an activity, with a function linked to a cost.
   
   You can assign a load manually but if you have entered a time slot then the load is automatically calculated. 
   
     
 .. compound:: Pause and stop session

   You can pause the session. This will remove user stories from the planning poker estimates screen without actually closing or stopping the session.
   
   Stop the session, will change the status of the latter to "done".
   
   User stories will still be visible on the estimates planning poker screen but you will no longer be able to vote.
   
   Change the status to **in progress** so that the :kbd:`pause` and :kbd:`closed` buttons are visible again.





.. rubric:: Closed a poker session

   
When all the votes are recorded, you have two options :

   * Close the vote
   * Turn the cards over
   
When you turn over the cards, the vote is indicated on each participant's card.

.. figure:: /images/GUI/AGILE_ZONE_PlanningPokerFlipCards.png
   :alt: Flip cards
   :scale: 60
   
   Flip cards
   
You then have the possibility to reset the votes and this in accordance with the Scrum method, until the vote is unanimous.

If all the votes are unanimous, when the user story is closed, the complexity point that was voted on is indicated.

.. figure:: /images/GUI/AGILE_BOX_PlanningpokerClosedOK.png
   :alt: close of unanimous votes
   
   Close of unanimous votes
   

If you close without the votes being unanimous, at the time of closing, the lowest and highest values are shown.

The lowest value is selected by default, but you can click the highest value to select it or select another value from the drop-down list.
