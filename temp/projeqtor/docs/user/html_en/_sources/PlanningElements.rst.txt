Planning elements
*****************

The planning elements :ref:`test-session` and :ref:`meeting` are described in their topics.

.. index:: Project 

.. _planningelem_project:

Project
-------

The project is the primary entity of ProjeQtOr.

It is also the top-level of visibility, depending on profiles.

.. rubric:: Sub-projects 

* You can define sub-projects on any project and this unlimited. 
* On the parent project screen, you can view the children in the subproject section.
* Then, the projects may not be real projects, but just organizational breakdown corresponding to an organization.

.. rubric:: Project type 

There are 3 types of projects which are not managed in the same way.

* Operational projects for work planning, 
* Administrative projects for recording unavailability 
* Template projects which will serve as models to be recovered.

See: :ref:`project type<project_type>`


.. rubric:: Fix planning 

* When the "correct planning" box is checked, the project planning will not be recalculated.
* This avoids modifying the expected values.
* Planning will always be the same no matter what you do on other projects.

.. warning:: This may lead to dependencies unconsistancies



.. rubric:: Non extendable project 

When project perimeter is fixed you can't:

   * add new elements to this project
   * delete elements from this project
   * move elements to or from this project

.. rubric:: Under construction

* When a project is under construction, no :ref:`automatic emails<notif-on-event>` will be sent, no :ref:`notifications<notifications>` or :ref:`alerts<automation>` will be generated for the project elements.
* A project can be under construction as long as it isn’t stated. Set to :term:`In progress` status.
* The resources don't see it on :ref:`timesheet<timesheet>`.



.. rubric:: Exclude from global plan

* Do not show the not plannable items for this project on the global planning view.
* This means that only standard planning items will be displayed excluding:

   * :ref:`Actions<action>`
   * :ref:`Decisions<decision>`
   * :ref:`Deliveries<deliveries>`
   
.. rubric:: Validated work treatment    

Activates treatment of the validated work based on the sum of the work of the project orders otherwise it will be calculated on the sum of the validated work of the activities.



.. rubric:: Manual indicators

* Fields: :ref:`Health status<health-status>`, :ref:`Quality level<quality-level>`, :ref:`Trend<trend>` and :ref:`Overall progress<overall-progress>` are manual indicators.
* They allow define visual way the general health, conformity, trend and progress of the project.
* Some manual indicators are displayed on the :ref:`Today screen<today-screen>`.

.. rubric:: Special fields

* The value of the fields the Project name, Sponsor, Project code and Contract code can be used as the substitute value of special fields.
* See: :ref:`administration-special-fields`

.. rubric:: Monitoring indicator

* The :ref:`indicators<indicator>` can be defined on the :ref:`progress data<progress-section>`.


.. _projet-donot-start: 

.. rubric:: Do not start project before Validated Start Date

* The schedule should only start from this date, as if there was a fixed milestone preceding the project.
* Resources cannot be charged to the project before the specified date (as with a project under construction). 
* This option must be enabled in the :ref:`global parameters<gp_planning-section>`.

.. _project-reserve:

.. index:: Project (Reserve)

.. rubric:: Project reserve

* Project reserve is an amount reserved based on identifying :ref:`Risks<risk>` and :ref:`Opportunity<opportunity>`.
* Calculated from contingency reserve of risks minus potential gain of opportunities.
* ProjeQtOr uses a technique as "Expected monetary value (EMV)" to convert risks and opportunities into an amount.
* The amount of project reserve will be added to remaining amount.

An activity is a kind of task that must be planned, or that regroups other activities.

An activity can be:

* Planned tasks.
* Change requests.
* Phases.
* Deliveries.
* Versions or releases.

.. rubric:: Assigned resources

* :ref:`Resources<resource>` are assigned to activities.
* During an :ref:`assignation<assignment-section>`, some work is initially planned on this activity for the resource.

.. rubric:: Real work allocation

* For a resource, assigned activities are tasks in which he can entry the :ref:`Real work<real-work-allocation>` 

.. rubric:: Activities regroupment

* Activities can have parents to regroup activities. 
* So a :term:`WBS` (work breakdown structure number) is calculated for the activities.
* Activities can be sorted inside their parent activity, on the :ref:`Gantt<Gantt_chart>` planning view, using drag and drop.
* Parent activity must belong to the same project.

.. _activity-planning:

.. rubric:: Activity planning: work on tickets

* :ref:`Tickets<ticket>` can be linked to an activity (task).
* Work on tickets will be included in the activity.

 .. compound:: **Assignment of resources to task**

    * Resources who will work on the ticket doesn't need to be assigned to linked activity before.
    * The assignment will be automatically created once that resource has entered the working time (real work) in the ticket.
    * The assigned task and the sum of working time entries by resource in tickets will be available in its timesheet.

.. rubric:: Fix planning 

* When box “fix planning” is checked, the activity scheduling won’t be remade.
* This will avoid change on planned values.
* The planning will always be the same whatever you do on other projects.

.. warning:: This may lead to dependencies unconsistancies


.. rubric:: Filter on list

Ability to filter activities by data or type, for instance by assigned resources

.. rubric:: Monitoring indicator

* The indicators can be defined in the :ref:`List of Values<list-of-values>`.

* See: :ref:`health-status` and :ref:`overall-progress`

A milestone is a flag in the planning, to point out key dates.

Milestones are commonly used to check delivery dates.

They can also be used to highlight the transition from one phase to the next.

ProjeQtOr offers two types of milestone:

 .. compound:: **Floating milestone**

    * This milestone will automatically move to take into account dependencies.

 .. compound:: **Fixed milestone**

    * This milestone is fixed in the planning, not taking into account predecessor dependencies.
    * This kind of milestone is interesting, for instance to set-up start date for some tasks.
    * Fixed date is set by validated date.

.. rubric:: Monitoring indicator

* The indicators can be defined in the :ref:`List of Values<list-of-values>`.

* See: :ref:`health-status` and :ref:`overall-progress`
