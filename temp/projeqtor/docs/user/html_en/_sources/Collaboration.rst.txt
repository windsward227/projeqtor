Voting management
*****************

ProjeQtOr gives users the possibility to vote on tickets, activities or requirements.

The voting functionality is a module and will need to be enabled through module management in order to be used.

To make an item votable you must create some use rules.

The principle is to assign points to users so that they can vote on a particular item.



.. _voting-attribution-rule:

Voting attribution rule
-----------------------

Points are assigned to a client and his contacts or to a user.

It is possible to assign fixed points or to assign points at a given frequency.

You can vote on tickets, activities and requirements.

The user can use his own points or the points of the customer to which he belongs, for this he must then be a contact of this client.

The allocation is recalculated when the user logs in, for himself and for the client to which he belongs.

The calculation is based on the last date of assignment of voting points.

   Voting attribution rules screen


On the voting rules screen click on |new| to create a new rule.

Fill in one of the voting elements. If the field is left empty, then the attribution will concern all the voting elements at the same time.

Fill in a value (number of points) to give to the user.


 .. compound:: fix value 
 
   You give a well-defined number of points that will not change.
   
   To reassign points, you must recreate a new attribution rule.
   
   
 .. compound:: periodicity of values
 
   You give a number of points which will increment at regular intervals.
   
   Every day, every week, every month or every year, the user will receive the number of points entered.
   
   
   
Attribution
___________

On the client or user screen, in the Voting attribution section you add the rules created beforehand.

Click |add| to add a rule.

The pop-up opens and you can choose the rule(s) that suits your needs.

The information is retrieved automatically from the allocation rule and the history of points spent.

You will be able to follow the evolution of your points directly on the customer or user screen.


 
.. _VotingUseRule:

Voting use rule
---------------

To be able to vote, it is necessary to create rules for the use of votes.

How the user will and can use their points, on what element and how to convert and equate points to workload days.

Click on |new| to create a new rule

Its points and those of the customer to which it belongs can therefore be accumulated.

The user votes on a ticket, an activity or on a requirement so that these are carried out.

The user can vote without having the rights to update the item, just with "read" rights on the element and a certain number of points.

The user can withdraw his points from one element to put them on another.

At a stage (status to be defined), the element can be blocked: the points can no longer be edited or deleted.



Vote
____

When a voteable item is defined, the voting attribution table is available on the respective screens of the items.

   Voting section



The target value is populated only if you have estimated work on the item.

Estimated work on tickets and requirements and validated workload on activities.

See: :ref:`Dates and duration<progress-section-date-duration>`



.. tip:: Convertion

   TargetValue = ceil (plannedWork * workPointConvertionRate)
   
   If work = 0,5j | rate = 3 --> points = 2
   
   There is no decimal value. Round up to the next whole.
   
   If work = 5j   | rate = 2 --> points = 10
   
   
   
Click on the vote button to access the voting pop-up.


.. figure:: /images/GUI/COLLAB_BOX_Vote.png

   Voting pop-up
   
Fill in the number of points you want to use for this vote.

You can see:

* limit per vote: indicates the maximum number of points you can use for voting this item.

* Own vote: the user uses his points in his own name.

* Client vote: The user uses the points attached to the customer as a contact.

* left points: indicates your remaining number of points for the user and for the customer.

* Comments are added as :ref:`note<note-section>` on the item page.


When a user/customer has voted, a tracking table allows you to see who has voted and how many points have been scored.

The rate indicates the percentage of progress for the vote of the element according to the target value and the number of votes.

To modify or delete your vote, click on the edit vote button. Leave the field empty or fill in 0 to cancel your vote.
