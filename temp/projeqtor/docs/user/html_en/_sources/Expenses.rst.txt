* You can create as much budget and sub budget as you want.

* An expense is related to a base budget, ie a budget item

* A budget item is linked to a parent budget 

* Only the current budget items will be displayed in the lists.

* Current, under construction and closed budgets will not appear in the lists. To view the closed items, check the "closed" box.

   If you change the name of a budget, remember to refresh the page so that the lists take into account the changes.
   

   * The parent budget exists only to consolidate the data of the underlying budget items.

   * You cannot modify the expenses in the Progress field of a parent budget.

   * Only the target amount can be changed if the budget treatment is still under construction.




 .. compound:: The budget item
  
   * The budget item is the finer element of the budget analysis. 
   * These posts or budget destinations will allow you to detail your budget, categorizing it at your convenience.
   * When you create a :ref:`project expenses<project-expense>` or an :ref:`individual expenses<individual-expense>`, you can link them to a specific budget item.

This area allow you to change the macro state of the budget.

* A budget may be under construction

* A budget under construction does not allow to see the fields "target amount" and prevents the modification of the estimated amount

* The "approved" macro-state changes and automatically cancels the "under construction" macro state. The date is then displayed in the fields of the macro-state concerned.

* Each sub-budget is then impacted and the "approved" state will then be propagated on all of his family.

* Each macro state "under construction", "approved", "closed" and "canceled" modified from the parent budget screen propagates in cascade over the entire budget hierarchy.

Terms of payments to providers
------------------------------

In France, inter-company payment periods are regulated and set at maximum 60 calendar days or 45 days end of month 
from the date of issue of the invoice. 

Failing to mention the payment period in the contract or the invoice,
it is legally fixed to 30 days after receipt of the goods or performance of the service. 

* Depending on the sector, deadlines are modifiable

* you can save, organize, track and edit your payment dates to your provider

* You can record one or more payment delays on each invoice to the service provider.

* A invoice can therefore be paid either in cash or in several installments.

* Each recorded due date, whether on the supplier orders screen or on the supplier invoices screen, generates a line on the terms screen.
