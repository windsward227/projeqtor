Tickets
*******

A ticket is a kind of task that cannot be scheduled in a unitary manner.

This is usually a short-lived activity for a single ticket that gives feedback to the issuer or to keep track of the result.


.. figure:: /images/GUI/TICKET_SCR_Presentation.png
   :alt: Tickets management screen
   
   Tickets management screen

It can be globally planned as a general activity, but not unitarily.

For instance, bugs should be managed through tickets : 

* You can not plan bugs before they are registered.
* You must be able to give a feedback on each bug.
* You can (or at least should) globally plan bug fixing activity. 

.. index:: Ticket (Simple) 

.. topic:: Tickets (simple) 

   * This screen is a limited version of screen "Tickets".
   * It's dedicated to users who want to create and follow their own tickets without be involved in their treatment.
   * When fields and features are available, the description is similar.
    

.. topic:: Restrict the entry of real work in the ticket

   * Possibility to define that only the responsible of ticket can enter real work.
   * This behavior can be set in  :ref:`Global parameters<auto-responsible>` screen.


.. rubric:: Due dates

* Initial and planned due date allows to define a target date for solving the ticket.

 .. compound:: **Initial due date**

    * If a definition of ticket delay exists for giving ticket type and urgency the date is automatically calculated with this delay.
    * :ref:`delay-for-ticket` screen allows to define ticket delay.
    
    .. note::

      Initial due date of the ticket set as read only if it is calculated from the setting of "delays for tickets"

 .. compound:: **Planned due date**

    * Is used to define a target date after evaluation.
    * Automatically initialized to the initial due date.

 .. compound:: **Monitoring indicator**

    * Possibility to define indicators to follow the respect of dates values.

    .. describe:: Respect of initial due date/time
    .. describe:: Respect of planned due date/time




.. rubric:: Product, component and versions fields

* Allows to identify the product and component relating to the issue.
* Identifies from which versions, the issue occurs and to which versions a resolution will be applied. 

   
 .. compound:: **Versions identified**

    * A ticket can identify all versions allocated.
    * Possibility to define a main version and the other versions allocated.
    * See: :ref:`Product concept<product-concept>`.




.. rubric:: Responsible of product

   
A responsible can be defined for a product or component.

If a product or component is selected, the responsible defined can be automatically assigned to the ticket.

.. note:: Ticket responsible from product responsible

   This parameter, in Global parameters, allows to define, if the defined responsible is automatically assigned to the ticket.

Priority value calculation
--------------------------

Priority value is automatically calculated from **Urgency** and **Criticality** values.

Priority, Urgency and Criticality values  are defined in lists of values screens. See: :ref:`priority`, :ref:`urgency` and :ref:`criticality` screens.

In the previous screens, a name of value is set with numeric value.  

Priority numeric value is determined by a simple equation as follows:

.. topic:: Equation

   * [Priority value] = [Urgency value] X [Criticality value] / 2
   * For example:

     * Blocking (4) X Critical (8) / 2  = Critical priority (16)for [Priority value] 

.. rubric:: Default values

* Default values are determined.
* You can change its values while respecting the equation defined above.

.. rubric:: Replies from Email

The processing of incoming mailboxes is adapted to simplify their use. The use of the mailbox for new tickets is the same for replies.

The reference of the element from which the email is sent is added in the subject of the email.

In the procedure for determining the origin of an incoming email, ProjeQtOr searches for the reference in the subject of the email.

* If it is not found, ProjeQtOr considers it a new request to be integrated as a new ticket.

* If the reference is found in the subject of the incoming email, then the reply is inserted on the element, like a note.



 .. compound:: Management of processed emails
   
   
   In the :ref:`global parameters<gp-automatic-import-replies>` you can determine, upon receipt of the email, whether you want to mark it as read or delete it.
   
   
   
   


     
     
.. _ticket-token:
     
Management of tokens on ticket
------------------------------


You can define and integrate tokens on tickets that you can track on your customer contracts.

The use of this feature is configurable and must be activated in the :ref:`modules management<module-management>` to have access to it.

A new screen for the definition of tokens will be accessible via the financial part incomes menu.



Token definition
================
   
The objective is to define all types of tokens likely to be ordered by your client.

.. figure:: /images/GUI/FINANCIAL_SCR_WorkTokenDefinition.png
   :alt: Token definition screen
   
   Token definition screen
 
You set values for a token.
   
   
 .. compound:: Duration

   Value of the token in days or hours (depending on the time recording unit in global parameters)     

 .. compound:: Amount

   Monetary value of the token in € (depending on the currency recording unit in global parameters) 

 .. compound:: Splittable token

   Defines if the token can be divisible, if half tokens can be entered

 .. compound:: Surcharge situations

   Enter situations of increase that may apply to tokens, such as night work, or even during days normally not worked
     
.. warning:: 

   When a token has been used on a ticket, it becomes impossible to modify it.

   Similarly, it is not possible to delete or modify the coefficient for a mark-up situation used on a line of work



.. _token-clientcontract:

Token on the client contract
============================

On the client contract, we will add a table with order management functions.

* Click on |Add| to add tokens to the order

**When you have entered the order, the table will indicate:**

 .. compound:: In the tokens ordered section

   * The type of tokens ordered and its description
   * The total amount of tokens ordered
   * the total duration to which the number of tokens corresponds
   * The total amount to which the number of tokens ordered corresponds

 .. compound:: In the tokens used part
 
   * The total number of tokens used without surcharges
   * The total number of tokens used with markup
   * the total duration of the tokens used with and without surcharges
   * The total cost of tokens used taking into account markups

 .. compound:: In the remaining tokens part
 
   * Display of the remaining duration of the tokens (duration ordered - duration used)
   * Display of the number of remaining tokens (amount ordered - amount used)

The Total Line, sums the numbers, amounts and durations (ordered, completed, remaining) for all types of tokens in the contract



   
   

Token on tickets
================

When you create a ticket on the project where the tokens have been defined then you will be able to select these tokens when dispatching the job.

.. figure:: /images/GUI/TICKET_BOX_DispatchWorkTokens.png
   :alt: Dispatch work with selection of tokens
   
   Dispatch work with selection of tokens
   
Click on |dispacth| to open the pop-up.

The start date and time are automatically filled in with the current dates and times.

* Select the resource working on the ticket
* Add the workload for this ticket
* Select the token corresponding to the need of the ticket
* Determine if a markup type applies to this ticket
* The quantity of tokens (without decimal if the token is not divisible)
* The mark-up rule, to be chosen from the rules defined on the token
* The number of increased tokens calculated by applying the increase rule
* If the billable box is checked then the tokens will not be counted on the customer contract. 


.. warning:: 

   The "Mark-up situations" are descriptive and may or may not be related to the time of execution. There will therefore be no automatic determination of the increase situation according to the day or time of the entry of the time spent.
   
      
.. index:: Synchronize ticket
.. index:: synchronization
      
      
.. _synchronize-ticket:
   
synchronize an activity and a ticket
------------------------------------

You can sync tickets with activities. So when you enable this option, all tickets are synced like this:

* We attach the activity as a planning activity of the ticket
* We link the activity with the ticket
* The ticket is entered as the origin of the activity
* We modify the state of the element which has the least advanced state to pass it to the state of its binomial (the most advanced).
* The other data is not synchronized (a gap may then exist if the ticket is attached to an existing activity).

.. figure:: /images/GUI/TICKET_ZONE_ProjectSynchronization.png
   :alt: Synchronization of tickets with activities
   
   Synchronization of tickets with activities


You activate the option directly on the project. More flexible solution that will allow great flexibility according to potentially different behaviors depending on the project.

This is a one-time link to avoid recursive updates. A ticket is synchronized with a single activity and an activity will be synchronized with a single ticket (unique pair).   

Synchronization functionality set on a project is not inherited to subprojects.

.. rubric:: Deleting a synced item


Click on **define synchronization** to open the pop-up.
   
.. figure:: /images/GUI/TICKET_BOX_DefinitionSynchronization.png
   :alt: Definition of synchronization
   
   Definition of synchronization
   
   

When activating the function on a project, a pop-up window will be displayed allowing to define:

* The status of the ticket automatically generating the activity
* The type of ticket concerned (optional, to allow all types of tickets to be covered)
* The type of activity to create
* An option to automatically trigger the attachment of the activity as a ticket schedule activity
* An option to sync existing tickets


 .. compound:: Treatment of the existing: Synchronize existing tickets

   When this option is selected, all unclosed tickets whose status is greater than or equal to the trigger status and whose type is the one specified will be synchronized with an activity.
   
   * If the ticket is already synced with an activity, nothing happens. This is the case of reactivating a previously deactivated rule.
   * If the ticket is attached to an open planning activity, the ticket is synchronized with this activity.
   * If the ticket originates from one and only one unclosed activity, it is synchronized with this activity. Otherwise we will create a new activity that will be synchronized with the ticket.
   
   In all cases of research of the activity to be attached, we make sure that it is not already synchronized with another ticket and that it does not originate from another ticket

   

When a Ticket or Activity item is edited and synced to a pair, changes to some fields carry over to their pair:

* Name
* Project
* State
* Responsible
* Product
* Component
* Target product version
* Target component version


 .. compound:: The project
 
   When you change the project of a ticket attached to a planning activity, a consistency check prevents you from making this modification since the two elements must be linked on the same project.
   
   In case of synchronization, the control is ignored and you can change the project on one of the two elements, the modification will be passed on to the other. 
   
   * If a ticket changes project or type before its triggered state, it is not synced.

     It is then subject to the new project or new type rule.
   
     A check is carried out to find out if the ticket is not already in the trigger state for the new project or the new type and to trigger the synchronization in this case.

   * If a ticket changes project or type after its triggered state, it's already synced. He continues to be synchronized with his partner according to the rule of his original project, whether his new project has a synchronization rule or not.

     The change of project of the ticket can also come directly from a modification on the ticket or from a modification of its binomial activity. 
   
     The rule is always the same: pair synchronization is maintained.
     
   
 .. compound:: The states and the workflow
 
   On certain status changes, certain fields may become mandatory and these fields are not necessarily synchronized. Like the description or the result. 
   
   In this case, these fields - not synchronized - are automatically filled in if they are in the element being modified.   
   
   If, despite everything, there are still invalid checks for the element to be synchronized, the update is globally rejected with an explicit message. 

   For example, closing a ticket associated with an activity on which there is still work to do should not be done.   
   
   
   In order for status changes to be consistent, the workflows between the ticket and the related activity should be the same to avoid inconsistencies in status changes.

   A mechanism will still make it possible to override the rules of the workflow for the element which will change state automatically.

   Essential, especially when creating the activity, which must be created directly in the same state as the ticket, but which will also be applied later.

   For example, if an activity has moved into a state that does not belong to the ticket's workflow, the state change is made to keep synchronization.

   Warning: This can lead to placing the ticket in a state from which it can no longer exit (because it is outside its workflow). In this case, only the change of state of the activity can unlock the ticket. 

   The same case can be produced on the activity which would be blocked following the change of state of the ticket.


.. rubric:: Workload

Attaching the activity as the Ticket's Schedule Activity will impact the load:

* The charge charged in real time to the ticket is recorded in the actual costs of the activity
* The charge charged in real time on the ticket is automatically decremented in the remaining charges of the activity

In the case of synchronized items, you can only enter actual load on the ticket. 

This charge will then be properly accounted for on the activity via the Planning Activity mechanism.


.. rubric:: Deleting a synced item

When a Ticket or Activity item is deleted and synced to a pair, a confirmation message is displayed to the user.

In this case, the associated item is not deleted, but the synchronization is deleted.




.. rubric:: deactivation of the function

In case of deactivation of the function at the project level, a check is carried out and alerts the user if there are tickets synchronized with activities.

* If there are synchronizations in progress, a pop-up window opens to display the number of existing pairs, distinguishing the number of closed and unclosed.

* If the number of existing pairs is not zero, you can select the existing links that must be kept or deleted.
   - In case the links are deleted, the function is completely disabled
   - In case the links are not deleted, the function is disabled only for tickets not yet synchronized. Tickets already synced remain synced. 

There is then no longer any way to delete the synchronization (except to delete one of the elements of the pair).
