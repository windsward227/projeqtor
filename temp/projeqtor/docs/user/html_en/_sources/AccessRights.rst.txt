Access Rights

This section allows the fine management of the rights as well as the management of the modules




.. index:: Profile (Access Rights)

.. _profiles: 

Profiles
--------


The profile is a group of rights. Each with specific access rights to the database.

Thus, each user is linked to a profile which defines the data that he can see and possibly manage.

.. _access-mode:

Access modes
------------
The access mode defines a combination of rights to Created, Read, Update or Delete items. 

It's the CRUD RIGHTS

Each access is defined as scope of visible and/or updatable, that can be, by kind of elements.




Project dependant
=================

By default, ProjeQtOr offers 10 different access modes.

Each access defines the visibility that can be applied by type of elements dependent on a project (activity, ticket, action, ...).

You can choose from several levels of visibility for each CRUD entitlement.

* **No element:** No element is visible and updatable.
* **Own elements:** Only the elements created by the user.
* **Elements he is responsible for:** Only the elements the user is responsible for.
* **Elements of own project:** Only the elements of the projects the user/resource is allocated to.
* **All elements on all projects:** All elements, whatever the project.

Not project dependant
=====================

The non-dependent elements of a project, such as organizations, parameters, lists of values, tools or even controls and automatisms can also be set with CRUD rights.

These elements must be visible. So the reading right is granted on a basic basis.

ProjeQtOr offers 5 different access modes where you can define creation, update and deletion rights.

* **yes:** allows the right to ...
* **no:** does not allow the right to ...
* **Own elements:** Only the elements created by the user.
* **Elements he is responsible for:** Only the elements the user is responsible for.

   
You can then define a mode corresponding to the visibility rights that you wish to grant on each profile in the access to data not dependent on the project.

The field "Name" in screens :ref:`profiles` and :ref:`access-mode` is not the name displayed, but it is a code in the translation table. 

The name displayed at right of the field is the translated name.

The translated name depends on user language selected in :ref:`User parameters<display-parameters>` screen.

   If translated name is displayed between square brackets [ ], then the value of field "Name" is not found in the translation table.

.. rubric:: Translation table files

* In ProjeQtOr, a translation table file is defined for each available language.
* The files are named "lang.js" and are localized in a directory named with ISO language code.

.. rubric:: How to modify the translation file?

* You can edit  file "lang.js" to add translation of new value or to modify the existing value translation.
* Or, you can download Excel file named "lang.xls", available on ProjeQtOr site. You can modify the translation tables of all languages and produce  files "lang.js".
