Humans Resources
****************

.. important:: **Documentation** 
   
   The human resources module was developed by an external contributor SALTO CONSULTING. The explanations below have been taken from the instructions, provided in French only, with the module.
   * `French documentation <https://www.projeqtor.org/files/ProjeQtOr%20-%20Documentation%20-%20Absences%20r%C3%A9glement%C3%A9es.pdf>`_ on the implementation of regulated absences is available on the `download page <https://www.projeqtor.org/fr/product-fr/downloads-fr/>`_

   The HR module was created in order to be easily adapted to French law, but it can be fully parameterized according to the rights of any country


This section allows to manage the society's Humans Resources. 

This system comes in addition to the standards of the management of absences.

Used to manage absences that must be validated, controlled and have values to be regulated according to French law.

For the module to be functional, you must define the employees, new status for resources or users. 

The absence manager in charge of leave, the types of leave you offer to your employees and the different types of employment contracts.


* Start to define the :ref:`employee-manager`, :ref:`leaves-types` and :ref:`employment-contract-type` 

* You can choose the leave entitlement standard for each type of contract

* The employee may reserve periods of leave of absence according to his rights.

* The system also includes a validation process of the requests during the leave period.


 .. compound:: Absence Administrator

   In order to be able to manage and configure the human resources module after its installation, you must access the :ref:`global parameters<leaves-system>`.
   
   A special additional HR section allows you to define the administrator of absences and regulated rights.
   


   It is thus possible to manage the paid holidays, the RTT, the Stopped diseases by treating:

      * Quantities acquired over a period of time
      * The period of validity of a quantity of absence 
      * The possibility or not to take early holidays over the period being acquired
      * The number of days before and after which the absence request can be made
      * Specific acquisition rules
      * Validation or rejection of an application
   
      .. note:: A project dedicated to these regulated absences is created and makes it possible to store the requested days of absence as planned time 
         and the days of absence validated as working time thus making it possible to integrate these absences in the planning.   




.. rubric:: Leaves States   

With the activation of the HR module, an absence workflow is added with 3 states, which are accessible and customizable in the :ref:`automation systems<workflow>`.

   .. compound:: Recorded

      Creation status. In this state all the data of the absence can be modified.
      
   .. compound:: Submitted

      This status means that the employee has sent his leave request to his hierarchy for validation.      
      
   .. compound:: Validated

      State that only the manager and the administrator of the module can be enabled.
      
      When the leave request is validated or refused, the status of the request cannot be changed
      
   .. compound:: Cancelled

      State that only the manager and the administrator of the module can be enabled.
            
      The number of days the absence represents are not taken.
      
      When the leave request is validated or refused, the status of the request cannot be changed


.. note:: 

   The calculation of the number of days represented by absence is done on the basis of working days.
   
   The working days are defined in :ref:`global_parameters` and :ref:`calendar<calendars>` associated with employee: holidays, non-working days.

Employees and Manager
=====================

.. sidebar:: Other section 

   * :ref:`resource`
   * :ref:`module-management`

The properties below is visible only when the :ref:`HR module<module-management>` is enabled


.. rubric:: Employee

An employee is a :ref:`resource` whose property **"is an employee"** is checked in the screen resources.
   
Once the resources are saved as employees, you can manage them from the employee screen.

You find the same fields of description as the resources.

In this section, the employee can see the person who manage its leaves periods.



 .. compound:: Employment Contract
      
   This section is visible and linked to the :ref:`employment-contract-type` screen.
   
   To an employee are associated a :ref:`employment-contract` and :ref:`leaves-rights-earned`.
         
   The contract is associated with a :ref:`employment-contract-type`.
         
   This allow the employee to associate the rules of acquisition, the special rules of regulated absences and the acquired rights by type of absence and by acquisition period.


.. rubric:: Manager

A manager is a resource whose properties **"is an employee"** and **"is absence manager"** are checked

.. figure:: /images/GUI/RH_ZONE_DescriptionManager.png
   :alt: Manager is a resource and the manager of leaves
   :align: center
   :scale: 70%
   
   Box **"is an employee"** and **"is manager of leaves"** is checked

A manager must be an employee.

An employee manager can make absence requests in lieu of employees.

He can validate or reject employee absentee requests that he manages.

.. important:: 

   The management of an employee is dated, which allows to change manager or temporarily delegate management to another manager (absences).

For example, if the company closes in August ...

The manager can register a request for his organization and under organization, for all the organizations, his entire team,
himself included



.. rubric:: Administrator

If an employee does not have a manager, the administrator of the Regulated absence module acts as manager.

The administrator is obligatorily a leave manager


.. warning::

   When a resource is no longer **"used"**, all the elements of the Regulated absence module are deleted by the module:
   
   • Assignments to activities associated with type of absence
   • Time spent generated following validated absence requests

The regulation of absences is based on the rights to take absences acquired over a given period.

It is therefore based on values to be given to attributes of regulation according to the type of absence (ex: Paid leave, RTT, sick leave, legal leave, etc.), and the type of contract associated with the employee (Ex: Full time, Part time).


.. rubric:: General acquisition of rights

When you create a :ref:`employment-contract-type`, you have several contractual values to fill in.

   * If you check on **"all"** the entered values will be on all contract types. 

   * These values can not be changed after they are saved.

   For any change, the creation of a new type of absence is necessary.

Skill Management
================

Skills management will make it possible to inform the skills of each resource with a very specific skill level.

You can then search for the appropriate resources for an activity at a given time for the skill of your choice.






Skills
------

Record the different skills that you find in your field of activity.


.. figure:: /images/GUI/HUMANR_SCR_Skillscreen.png
   :alt: Skill management screen
   
   Skill management screen

Skills can be split into sub-skills without level limitation.

The "display the structure" button allows you to display the SBS (skill Breakdown Structure) of the selected skill with an indentation of the sub-skills for better visibility.

For example beginner, average, good, expert...


.. figure:: /images/GUI/HUMANR_SCR_SkillLevelScreen.png
   :alt: Skill level screen
   
   Skill level screen
   
You then define for each of the resources the skills and the level associated with it.

An icon can be associated with the skill level. ProjeQtOr has provided icons for a maximum of 4 levels.

You can create your own icons and place them in www\\projeqtorVX.xx\\view\\icons.


.. rubric:: Skills resources

When skills and skill levels are defined, you can associate them with your resources.

.. figure:: /images/GUI/HUMANR_ZONE_ResourceSkills.png

.. tip:: 

   The calculation of the relevance rate takes into account the resource parameters (FTE, planning, multi-project, etc.) and the level of skill requested.
   
   The relevance rate is defined using a simple calculation.
   Availability rate x competence rate / 100.


.. rubric:: Filters

You can search skill with or without skill level. 

You can display only the resources corresponding to the selected skill.

Choosing the skill level will allow you to display a more relevant availability rate.

When you select a project in the display filters, its start and end dates are retrieved from the start and end fields of availability.



 .. compound:: Sort order
 
   You have the option of ranking the rates in ascending order for each skill line.
   
   You can choose to sort by Global values (availability x skill), availability value or skill.
   
   Sorting will be done for each skill line
