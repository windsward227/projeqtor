.. _planning_management:

Planning management
*******************

ProjeQtOr provides all the elements needed to build a planning from workload, constraints between tasks and resources availability.

.. topic:: **Multiple Access** 

   Users can edit the same item (if they have the right) at the same time, without disturbing each other, as long as they don't edit and save exactly the same field and at the exact same time.

.. index:: Planning management (Project)

.. rubric:: Project

The project is the main element of ProjeQtOr. it is a planning element. See: :ref:`Project<planningelem_project>` 

It is also the highest level of visibility and definition of access rights based on profiles.

You can define profiles, some have visibility on all projects, others only on the projects they are assigned to.

You can also define sub-projects of a project and sub-project of sub-projects without limit to this hierarchical organization.

This allows for example to define projects that are not real projects, but just a definition of the structure for your organization.

Projects and sub-projects appear on the :ref:`Gantt Planning view<Planning>`.




.. index:: Planning management (Activity)
 
.. rubric:: Activity
 
An activity is a task that must be planned, or includes other activities. It is a planning element. See::ref:`Activity<activity>`

This is usually a task that has a certain duration and should be assigned to one or more resources.

Activities appear on the :ref:`Gantt Planning view<Planning>`.







.. index:: Planning management (Milestone)

.. rubric:: Milestones
 
A milestone is an event or a key date of the project.

Milestones are commonly used to track delivery dates or force a start date of activity.

They can also be used to highlight the transition from one phase to the next one.

Unlike activities , milestones have no duration and no work.

But on Projeqtor, you can specify deadlines (positive or negative) to apply to your milestones 

See: :ref:`Milestones<milestonesgantt>`






.. index:: Planning management (Resource)

.. rubric:: Resources
 
Resources can be assigned to activities. See::ref:`Resource`

This means that some work is defined on this activity for the resource.

Only the resources allocated to the project of the activity can be assigned to the activity.





.. index:: Planning management (Real work allocation) 

.. rubric:: Real work allocation
 
Resources enter their time spent on the Real work allocation screen in their :ref:`timesheet<timesheet>`.

This allows for a real-time monitoring of work.

Moreover, updating the left work allows to recalculate the planning taking into account the actual progress on each task.






.. index:: Planning management (Planning)

.. rubric:: Planning
 
The planning is based on all the constraints defined:

   * left work on each activity
   
   * availability of resources
   
   * rate of resource allocation to projects. 
     
     See: :ref:`allocation-section` and :ref:`Allocation rate<allocationrate>`

   * assignment rate of resources to activities. 
   
     See: :ref:`assignment-section` and :ref:`Assignments rate<assignmentrate>`
   
   * planning mode for each activity (as soon as possible, fixed duration, ... ). 
   
     See::ref:`Planning modes<planningmodeGantt>`
   
   * dependencies between activities. 
   
     See: :ref:`Dependencies<dependencylinks>`
   
   * priorities of activities and projects. 
   
     See: :ref:`Priority<Priority>` and :ref:`Planning priority<scheduling-priority>` 

   * The planning is displayed as a :ref:`Gantt chart<Planning>`.




.. index:: Planning management (Project portfolio)

.. rubric:: Project Portfolio
 
The planning can also be viewed as a :ref:`project portfolio<project-portfolio>`, which is a Gantt planning view restricted to one line per project, plus optionally selected milestones.

.. index:: Planning management (Global Planning)

.. rubric:: Global Planning
 
The :ref:`Global Planning<gantt-planning>` allows you to display many more elements on the gantt chart in addition to the usual projects, activities, and milestones.

In this diagram view, you can view decisions, test sessions, deliveries, risks, tickets or opportunities ... 

All of which can be linked to an activity or any other element of the diagram. 

.. index:: Planning management (Resource planning)

.. rubric:: Resource Planning
 
You can display the planning for each :ref:`resource<resource>`, but also by :ref:`teams<team>`, by :ref:`pool of resources<pool>` or you can display all the resources whatever their :ref:`assignments<assignment-section>`.

.. index:: Resource management

Resource management
*******************

ProjeQtOr manages the availability of resources that can be allocated to multiple projects. Tool calculates a reliable, optimized and realistic planning.

.. index:: Resource management (Resource)
.. rubric:: Resources

A :ref:`resource<resource>` can be a person working on the activities of one or more projects. Or material assigned to a particular task.

A resource can also be a group of persons for which you do not want to manage individual detail. See: :ref:`Teams<team>` and :ref:`Pool of resources<pool>`

You can manage this through the capacity of the resource, :ref:`FTE<fte>`, that can be greater than 1 (for a group of people for example) or less than 1 (for a person working part-time).

.. index:: Resource management (Allocation)
.. rubric:: Allocations
 
The first step is to allocate each resource to the projects on which it has to work.

Specifying the :ref:`allocation rate<allocationrate>` (% of maximum weekly time spent on this project) 

Where again the periods during which it will be planned on these projects.

.. index:: Resource management (Assignment)
.. rubric:: Assignments
 
Then you can assign resources to project activities.

You fill in the workload you assigned to the resource.

Only the resources allocated to the project of the activity can be assigned to the activity.

See: :ref:`Assignments<assignment-section>`

.. index:: Resource management (Calendar)
.. rubric:: Calendars
 
To manage working and non-working days, for resources with reduced working hours or with a different rhythm from the French calendar, 
for days off or public holidays, you have configurable calendars.

You can create multiple calendars to manage different types of availability.

* you can create a '80% 'calendar with every Wednesday closing day, for example.

* you can manage separate vacations when working with international teams.

* A calendar is assigned to each resource.

.. topic:: **more details**

   * :ref:`Calendars<calendars>` 
   

.. index:: Resource management (Real work allocation)
.. rubric:: Real work allocation
 
Resources enter their time spent on the :ref:`Timesheet screen<timesheet>`. This allows for a real-time monitoring of work.

The planning recalculation takes into account the left work and makes it possible to take into account the actual progress on each task.
   










.. index:: Tickets management

Tickets management
******************

ProjeQtOr offers a Ticketing environment. 

With its bug tracking to monitor incidents on your projects, you with the ability to include work on planned tasks of your projects.

.. index:: Tickets management (Ticket)
.. rubric:: Ticket

A Ticket is an intervention that does not need to be planned or that cannot be planned.

It is generally a short task, whose granularity, too small, cannot correspond to an activity and whose progress you want to follow to describe and provide a result.

For example, bug fixes or issues can be handled through tickets. You cannot plan bugs until they are identified and logged, and you must be able to provide a solution to a bug (workaround or workaround).

* Ticket management allows you to program :ref:`delays<delay-for-ticket>` according to the type of ticket

* As on an activity it is possible to estimate the workload.

* You can assign a :term:`coordinator` and/or a manager.

* It is possible :ref:`to attach external documents<attachment-section>`, :ref:`to link other elements<linkelement-section>`, to leave :ref:`notes<note-section>`...





.. index:: Tickets management (Ticket simple)

.. rubric:: Simple tickets

Simple tickets are just simplified representations of Tickets for users that will "create" tickets but not "treat" them.
 
Elements created as simple tickets are also visible as Tickets, and vice versa.

Workflows are defined to monitor changes of possible status.

This allows, among other things, to restrict certain profiles from changing some status.

You can, for instance, limit the change to a validation status to a given profile, to ensure that only an authorized user will perform this validation.

See: :ref:`workflow`





.. index:: Quality management (Ticket delay)
.. rubric:: Delays for tickets
 
You can set delays for tickets or on ticket types. This will automatically calculate the expiry date of the Ticket when creating the Ticket.

The supported and closing time of the ticket can be defined and calculated for statistical purposes.

See: :ref:`Delay for tickets<delay-for-ticket>`





.. index:: Quality management (Indicator and alert)
.. rubric:: Indicators
 
Indicators can be calculated relative to respect of expected work, end date or cost values.

Some indicators are configured by default, and you can configure your own depending on your needs.

Non respect of indicators (or the approach of non-respect target) can generate Alerts.

See: :ref:`indicator`



 

.. index:: Quality management (Checklist)
