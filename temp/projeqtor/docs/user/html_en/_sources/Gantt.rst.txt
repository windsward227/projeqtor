Planning
********

The Gantt chart is a tool used in scheduling and project management and allowing to visualize in time the various tasks composing a project.

It is a representation of a connected graph, evaluated and oriented, which makes it possible to graphically represent the progress of the project.

.. note:: For large projects, with many sub-projects and activities, we limit the number of lines to display so as not to deteriorate performance, even if the project selector has already contextualized the display

.. _Gantt_chart:

Gantt chart
-----------

This screen allows to define projects planning and follow progress.

**The Gantt Chart is composed of five areas:**

.. _ActivityPlanningCalculation:

.. rubric:: |oneBLC| Activity planning calculation

When you make a modification on an element of your project, the project must then be recalculated to take it into account.

You have the option of using the automatic calculation function, which, if you make a modification on the planning screen, and only on this screen, will immediately take this modification into account.

If the modification is made on another screen, even if you have selected automatic calculation then, you will have to restart the calculation on the planning screen.



* Click on |Plan| to start the activity planning calculation.

* A popup window appears with the list of projects. 

* The check boxes allow you to select one or more projects to recalculate.



.. figure:: /images/GUI/GANTT_BOX_Calculation.png
   :alt: Project selection popUp for project calculation
   
   Project selection popUp for project calculation 


If you have selected one or more projects with :ref:`Project Selector<project-selector>` then the selected projects will be automatically checked.
   
Choose the date on which you want to recalculate the project.  

By checking the "Hide unselected projects" box, you will only have the projects selected in the project selector and they will be automatically checked.


.. index:: Overuse

.. _overuse-calculation:


 .. compound:: Overuse
  
   The overuse option allows you to allocate to all the resources and this, on the projects of your choice, maximum overbooking.

   This allows you to see the amount of work that is overused for the resources assigned to the task for each period of time.

   .. Warning::

      This function is dangerous, it does not reflect reality.
   
      For this reason, by default, it is not activated, even for the administrator.

      See: :ref:`specific_access` in the Planning section access rights









.. _auto-run:

.. rubric:: |twoBLC| Automatic run plan

Swith the button to activate automatic calculation on each change.
  
Only works on the Gantt Planning view. 

If the modification of an element is carried out on the dedicated screen of the element, then it is necessary to click again on BUTTON to restart the computation

All modifications about assignement (rate, name or numbers of resources, dates...) done are not displayed on the new planning screen until having, for this purpose, activited the planning calculation, either in an automatic run plan or not.
  
On the contrary, the screen planning will not change even if modifications have been loaded yet.




 .. compound:: Automatic calculation

  **Differential calculation =** calculation of projects that require a recalculation.
  
  **Complete calculation =** calculation of all projects

  
  The calculations are programmed according to a frequency of CRON type (every minute, every hour, at a given hour every day, at a given time on a given week day, ...)
  
  See: Global Parameters into the chapter :ref:`Automatic planning Calculation<automatic-planning-calcul>`




.. _new-element-gantt:

.. rubric:: |threeBLC| Add a new planning element

* Allows you to create a new planning element.
* The element is then added under the previously selected element and with the same level of incrementation
* The element is added to the Gantt chart and the detail area adapts to the content created.
* The details area allows you to complete the entry.

.. figure:: /images/GUI/GANTT_TIP_CreateNewItem.png

You can create several elements on the planning view and more on to the :ref:`Global planning<gantt-planning>`.





.. _advanced-filter-gantt:

.. rubric:: |fourBLC| Advanced Filter

The advanced filter allows to define clause to filter and sort.

More details: :ref:`filters<filters>`
   
 
 
 
.. _displayed-columns-gantt:

.. rubric:: |fiveBLC| Displayed columns

This functionality allows to define columns displayed in the progress data view.

More details: :ref:`Display and organize the columns<columns>`. 
 
 
 
 
.. _other-option:

.. rubric:: |sixBLC| Display other options 
 
Clicking the icon will bring up the additional options window. 
 
 
 
 
.. _display-from:

.. rubric:: |sevenBLC| Display from... to... 

Change the start and / or end date to limit or extend the display of a Gantt Chart.

If the display is truncated because the project is too long, think to change the display scale.


  .. compound:: All the projet

   Check **All the project** for the Gantt chart to show all project tasks when possible.

  .. compound:: Saving dates  

   Save your dates of display to retrieve them on every connection.






.. _planning-validation:

.. rubric:: |eightBLC| Planning validation

Allows you to replace the validated dates with the planned dates.


.. figure:: /images/GUI/GANTT_BOX_StorePlannedDates.png
   :alt: Dialog box - Store planned dates
   :align: center

   Store planned dates

With this approach, you validate in a way any possible delay on the activities of your project.

Two actions are available: **Always** or **If empty**.


  .. compound:: Always

    Will overwrite existing values.
    
    If values are entered in the "validated" fields then, they will all be replaced by the planned dates (calculated by the software)
    
  .. compound:: If empty
      
    Will not overwrite existing values.  
    
    If the "validated" fields are not completed, then these dates will be replaced by the planned dates.
    
    If the "validated" fields are completed then they will be kept.
    
    







.. _save-baseline:

.. rubric:: |nineBLC| Save and show baseline

The baseline is a record of the planning state at a time T.


.. figure:: /images/GUI/GANTT_ZONE_Baseline.png
   :alt: Save a baseline
   
   Save a baseline
  
You can create as many baselines as you want per day, but you can only save one baseline per day. Each new baseline must replace the previous one.
  
  
  .. compound:: Save baseline
  
   Saved a baseline with the button |Baseline|. 
   
   Enter the project on which to create the baseline. The list of existing baselines, already registered, is available via this window. You can modify your baseline or delete it to save another one.
  
   .. figure:: /images/GUI/GANTT_BOX_Baseline.png
      :alt: Record baseline
   
      Record baseline





  .. compound:: Show baseline
  
   You can display two baselines at the same time. The one above the current activity bars of your project. The other below.
   
   Each of them has a different color, pale blue for the top line and pale purple for the bottom line
   
   .. figure:: /images/GUI/GANTT_ZONE_Baseline.png
      :alt: Display two baselines
      
      Display two baselines
      

   This option will be very useful for you to compare possible drifts and explain them. 





.. _print-export-gantt:

.. rubric:: |tenBLC| Print and Export the Gantt chart

You can print directly on your printer or export in PDF format or in MS Project format





  .. compound:: Print planning

   Click on the button |Print| to print the Gantt chart in A4 and / or A3 format.

   The print quality, despite printing or exporting on a reduced scale, remains very qualitative and offers very little loss of detail in the diagram.






  .. compound:: Export planning to PDF

   Allows to export planning to PDF format.
   Export can be done horizontally (landscape) or vertically (portrait) in A4 and / or A3 format
   with great detail even with a zoom

   Export contains all details and links between tasks and also include a pagination.
   
   And the option **Repeat Headers** allow you to print or export your planning in multiple pages
   
   .. figure:: /images/GUI/GANTT_BOX_ExportPlanningPDF.png
      :alt: Dialog box - Export planning to PDF
      :align: center

      Export planning to PDF


   This feature will execute export on client side, in your browser. Thus the server will not be heavy loaded like standard PDF export does.
   
   It is highly faster than standard PDF export.

   .. warning:: 
   
      This technically complex feature is highly dependent on the browser and is not compatible with all of them.
      It is compatible with the latest versions of IE (v11), Firefox, Edge and Chrome. Otherwise, the old export function will be used.
   
   .. tip:: 

      **Forced feature activation/deactivation**
      
      * To enable this feature for all browsers, add the parameter **$pdfPlanningBeta='true';** in parameters.php file.
      * To disable if for all browsers, add the parameter **$pdfPlanningBeta='false';** 
        Default (when **$pdfPlanningBeta** parameter is not set) is *enabled with Chrome, disabled with other browsers* 


  .. index:: Export to MS Project

  .. compound:: Export planning to MS Project

   You have the option of exporting XML in MS Project. 

   Click on the button |msProject| to start the export. 


   A **user parameter** allows you to enter if you want to add the assignments when exporting the project to MS-Project format.

   If not, the name of the resources will not be available in the MS-Project application   
   
   See: User Parameters into the chapter :ref:`UP-print-export` 
     















.. _checkbox-gantt:

.. rubric:: |elevenBLC| Other options: checkbox for display

At the end of the first zone, you have the choice to display or not, certain information on the Gantt chart.

  .. compound:: Show WBS
  
   Click on "Show WBS" to display the :term:`WBS` number before the names.

   .. figure:: /images/GUI/GANTT_ZONE_TaskWBS.png
      :alt: Task list with WBS display
      
      Task list without and with WBS Display


  .. compound:: Closed item 
  
   Flag on "Show closed items" allows to list closed items.
   
   
  .. compound:: Resource
  
   The Resource checkbox allows you to directly display the resources assigned to each activity on the Gantt chart.

   A user parameter allows you to choose between displaying names or initials.

   Choose if you want names, initials or nothing to appear on the Gantt chart.
   
   See: :ref:`display-parameters`
   
      
      


.. _critical-path:

  .. compound:: Show Critical path

      **The critical path** allows you to determine the total duration of your project. This is the longest sequence of tasks that must be completed for the project to be completed on time.
      
      **The Critical Chain**, meanwhile, is a technique for planning and monitoring deadlines but has the same principle: take into account the constraints to determine the duration of the project and the critical tasks that may impact this duration.
      One of these constraints is the taking into account of resource or skill limitations in addition to the dependencies between the tasks and the implementation of buffers, i.e. time reserves, in the critical chain and the secondary chains.
      
      ProjeQtOr offers you a critical chain rather than a critical path, but for better understanding, the term Critical path has been retained.
      
      * click on the **critical path** check box to calculate and display the red path in the Gantt schedule.
      
      .. figure:: /images/GUI/GANTT_ZONE_CriticalPath.png
         :alt: Critical Path
         :align: center
         
         The red net represents the critical path of the project. 
      
      .. note::
         
         The tasks of the project which are not crossed by the critical path are elements which will not affect the duration of the project and, even modified, will not automatically involve a modification of this duration for the entire project.


  .. compound:: Hide models project

      You can display or hide the template type projects in the area list.




.. _task-list:

Task List
=========

The task list displays the planning elements in hierarchical form by dividing the :term:`WBS`.

Tasks are regrouped by projects and activities.

The projects displayed depend on the selection made with **the project selector**

.. index:: Dependency Links

.. _dependencylinks:

.. rubric:: |threeBLC| Dependency links

Dependencies allow to define the execution order of tasks (sequential or concurrent).

All planning elements can be linked to others.

Dependencies can be managed in the Gantt chart and in screen of planning element.

Dependencies between planning elements are displayed with an arrow.


 .. compound:: Create a dependency

   To create a dependency, left click on a bar of the gantt (the predecessor) and slide towards the successor.
   
   You can also create dependencies with the predecessor and successor tables at the bottom of the details area. 
   
   Remember than the first task always drives the second.

 .. compound:: Modify a dependency
    
   Click on the arrow which turns orange, a pop up is displayed allowing you to modify the type and one to add a possible delay.
   
   The delay can be positive or negative. Negative delay allows overlapping of certain tasks

   See the strict mode of dependencies

 .. compound:: Dependency types

  .. compound:: |DependancyES| End-Start 
  
    The second activity can not start before the end of the first activity.

  .. compound:: |DependancySS| Start-Start
  
    The successor can not begin before the beginning of the predecessor. Anyway, the successor can begin after the beginning of the predecessor.

  .. compound:: |DependancyEE| End-End
  
    The successor should not end after the end of the predecessor, which leads to planning "as late as possible". 
    
    Anyway, the successor can end before the predecessor. Note that the successor "should" not end after the end of predecessor, but in some cases this will not be respected:
    
    * if the resource is already 100% used until the end of the successor
    * if the successor has another predecessor of type "End-Start" or "Start-Start" and the remaining time is not enough to complete the task
    * if the delay from the planning start date does not allow to complete the task
 


 .. compound:: Strict mode for dependencies
   
   The strict dependency mode forces the successor planning element not to start on the same day as the same predecessor but the next day. Even if the task is finished before the end of the day.

   To have the successor start on the same day or before the end of the predecessor task, select NO for strict mode or you can also put a negative delay.

   The strict dependency mode is a :ref:`global parameter<gp_planning-section>`.

   By default, the strict dependency mode is set to YES.

Planning Modes
==============

Projeqtor offers several ways to plan the workload for your resource with 11 different planning modes.

* :ref:`As soon as possible<mode-assoon>`
* :ref:`Work together<mode-worktogether>`
* :ref:`Must start before...<mode-startbefore>`
* :ref:`Should end before...<mode-endbefore>`
* :ref:`Regular between dates<mode-regular>`
* :ref:`Regular between dates in full dat<mode-regularFull>`
* :ref:`Regular between dates in half day<mode-regularHalf>`
* :ref:`Regular between dates in quarter day<mode-regularQuarter>`
* :ref:`Recurring<mode-recurring>`
* :ref:`Fixed duration<mode-fixedduration>`
* :ref:`Manual planning<mode-manualplanning>`
* :ref:`Minimum threshold & not splitted work<minimumthreshold>`



.. _mode-assoon:

.. rubric:: As soon as possible

The task is planned to finish as soon as possible.

.. note:: For tasks "as soon as possible", if no assignment is created but the validated work is defined, take the validated work as the default duration (instead of 1 days)

:ref:`|MODES|<planningmodeGantt>` 




.. _mode-worktogether:

.. rubric:: Work together

When two or more resources are assigned to the same task, planning tries to find periods where all resources are available to work together.

Periods are searched "as soon as possible".

If only one resource is assigned, this planning mode is exactly the same as "As soon as possible".

If one resource is assigned more work than the other, the extra work is planned after working together periods.

:ref:`|MODES|<planningmodeGantt>` 




.. _mode-startbefore:

.. rubric:: Must not start before validated date

The validated start date field must be set.

The task must not begin before a specific date.

.. note:: 
   You have the possibility to define dates directly on the project. 
   If no other constraint is applied to the elements of the latter, the planning will start only from the dates entered on the project.

:ref:`|MODES|<planningmodeGantt>`  



    
     
.. _mode-endbefore:

.. rubric:: Should end before validated end date

The validated end date field must be set.

The task is planned backward from end to start.
     
"Floating" backward planning is not possible, validated end date must be defined. 

:ref:`|MODES|<planningmodeGantt>` 






.. _mode-regular:

.. rubric:: Regular between dates

* Allows to evenly distribute work between two dates.
* Used for management recurrent activities.
* The validated dates fields must be set.
* Possibility to readjust the task with handles directly on the bar of the Gantt view.

   
.. figure:: /images/GUI/GANTT_ZONE_Regular.png
   :alt: Regular between dates
      
   Regular between dates mode


Examples of the planning modes upcoming are based on 2 work days to plan on 10 days.

Work will be evenly divided between on working days. For instance, 0.2 days during 10 days.

.. _mode-regularExcess:

 .. compound:: Regular modes with excess workload

    If the dates are too short compared to the assigned load, the excess load will be divided and added in the same way as the chosen mode.
    
    So you can get full days even in regular mode in quarter day or half days.
    
      * Example with 8 days of workload to plan over 10 days with the Regular mode in half days between dates 
    
      .. image:: /images/GUI/GANTT_ZONE_RegularHalf.png
         :alt: Regular in half day with excess workload
         
         
    The load is distributed regularly so as to respect the dates.


      .. image:: /images/GUI/GANTT_ZONE_RegularExcess.png

    If the load is too high to meet the dates, the excess load will be distributed over the whole day after the validated end date and will therefore be late (red color)

See also: :ref:`Regular modes with excess workload<mode-regularExcess>`

:ref:`|MODES|<planningmodeGantt>` 


.. _mode-recurring:

.. rubric:: Recurring (on a weekly basis)
  
This new mode allows reserving availability on recurring tasks on a weekly basis, for example 1/2 day every Monday, 1h every day, ... 
    
Activities in this mode dynamically assign the work based on the start and end bounds:
    
       * Start defined with a dependence End-Start or Start-Start
       * End defined with an end-end dependency
       * Planning mode for which the assigned work is not fixed
       * Workload distributed weekly
       * Adapts to the duration of the project

See: :ref:`Recurrent mode assignment<recurrent-mode-assign>`
   
:ref:`|MODES|<planningmodeGantt>` 






.. _mode-fixedduration:

.. rubric:: Fixed duration

* The task is planned by duration.
* The task is “floating” depending on predecessors.
* The validated duration field must be set.
* It is not necessary to assign resources to the task.
* If work is assigned to the task, planning behavior is the same as "Regular between dates" but with floating task. 
* Possibility to readjust the task with handles directly on the bar of the Gantt view.

.. note::

   If you want fixed duration with fixed start, use "Regular between dates", or use milestone to define start.

:ref:`|MODES|<planningmodeGantt>` 


.. _mode-manualplanning:

.. rubric:: Manual planning

* This is the most priority planning mode and constraint.

* You have the option to save the work as scheduled or actual work. 

* Two screens are dedicated to it: :ref:`planned interventions<planned-interventions>` to plan monthly and the :ref:`View interventions<view-interventions>` for read-only.

.. note::

   The choice of planned or actual work is made in the global parameters in the planning section work tab.

   See: :ref:`global parameters<GP-effectCapacity>`.

:ref:`|MODES|<planningmodeGantt>` 


.. _minimumthreshold:

.. rubric:: Minimum threshold & not splitted work
   
When this value is set, the activity will only be scheduled on the day when the daily availability is greater than or equal to this threshold.

You also have the option to add a new property to a “cannot be split” task.

This will require defining the minimum work to be allocated each day and therefore filling in the minimum threshold field.

Be careful with this mode, planning will require finding consecutive days with at least the given value possible, which may never happen.
