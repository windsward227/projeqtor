ProjeQtOr integrates some EDM functionalities, and allows you to manage documents and follow the evolution of document versions. Each document or document version can then be linked to an element of ProjeQtOr (Project, Activity or other).


.. sidebar:: Concepts 

   * :ref:`product-concept`

A document is a reference element that gives a description of a project or product.

The document element describes the general information.

The file will be stored in the tool as versions.

.. rubric:: Type of versioning

A document can evolve following four ways defined as versioning type :

   .. compound:: **Evolutive**
   
    * Version is a standard Vx.y format. 
    * It is the most commonly used versioning type.

    * This versioning type is commonly used for recurring documents.
    * For instance : Meeting reviews.
   
   .. compound:: **Custom**

    * This versioning type is commonly used for external documents, when version is not managed by the tool, or when the format cannot fit any other versioning type.



.. rubric:: Document viewer

Should be checked when version is validated.

Only one version can be the reference for a document.

This icon |Comment| appears when the description field is filled.

Moving the mouse over the icon will display description text.





.. _approval-process-doc:

Approval process
----------------
      
You can define approvers for a document.

Only users assigned to the project linked to the document can be added.
  
* Click on |Add| to add an approver
* Click on |Delete| to delete an approver


.. rubric:: The approvers

When an approver is created in the list, the approver is also automatically added to the latest version of the document.
   
When adding a version to the document, approvers are automatically added to the version.

Each approver can see the list of documents to approve on their Today screen.

.. figure:: /images/GUI/DOCUMENT_ZONE_TodayDoc.png
   :alt: Document to approve
   
   Documents to be approved on the today screen
   
On the Documents screen, the approver can approve or reject the document.

All approvers of the document can view the response of other approvers.   


.. figure:: /images/GUI/DOCUMENT_ZONE_Approve.png
   :alt: Document to approve

Once the document is **approved**, the line is then checked and the date and time of the approval recorded.

If the document is **rejected**, the line is then marked with a cross with date and rejection cause.


  .. compound:: Approval status
  
   This status allows you to globally track the status of the approval.
   
   It can be used in a filter, like all the other fields of the document object.
   
   calculated according to the approval status of the latest version of the document and may take the following values:
   
   * **Without approval:** if no approver has been added to the list of approvers
   * **Rejected:** if at least one approver rejected the version of the document
   * **Pending approval:** if there is at least one approver who has not approved the document and no one has yet rejected the version of the document
   * **Approved:** if all approvers approved the document.  
   
   .. note:: 
      The quick search only display documents that are in directories to which the user has rights.
  
  .. compound:: Send a reminder email to approvers

   Send an email to approvers who have not yet validated the document.

.. index:: Document (Directories management) 

.. _document-directory:

Document directories
--------------------

Document directories management allows to define a structure for document storage.

.. rubric:: Location

* The files of document will be stored in the folder defined by the parameters  **Document root** and **Location**.

* **Document root** is defined in :ref:`Global parameters<file-directory-section>` screen. 

* **Location** is automatically defined as «Parent directory» / «Name».

* **Product** will be the default to new stored documents in this directory.
   
   - If the project is specified, the list of values contains the products linked the selected project.
      
   - If the project is not specified, the list of values contains all products defined.

* The **Default type** will be the default to new stored documents in this directory.


.. _directory-access-rights:

.. rubric:: Directory access rights

* The list of documents only displays Documents that are in directories for which the user has read rights.

* You can define the access rights to documents according to the profile at each level of the document directory tree.

* There is no notion of inheriting rights to subdirectories.

* You define for each profile the CRUD right (create / read / update / delete) on each directory.

* The rights defined in the "Project dependent data access" rights screen will only be used as a definition of default values when creating a directory.

See: :ref:`Documents rights per directory<doc-rights-per-directory>` 
  
.. note:: 

   * Note that if a directory is dedicated to a project, the profile used for assigning rights is the user's profile on this project, otherwise it is his default profile.
   
   * The assignment of modification or deletion rights without assigning read rights is inconsistent and will not be taken into account.
